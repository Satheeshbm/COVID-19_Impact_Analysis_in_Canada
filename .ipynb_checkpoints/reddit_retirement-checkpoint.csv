0,auspiciousham,alberta,"Identifying a poverty line issue doesn't justify giving everybody an allowance. There are other, more logical methods to bringing the impoverished up to a living wage rather than throwing away a lot of money on people that don't need it. UBI isn't a safety net or a top-up, it's Universal, and the money is a complete waste in the majority of our country.

What your describing is the framework of present day capitalism and not liking it. You still have to do all of that shit if you receive UBI, it's not like it suddenly absolves you of the eight hour work day. In this fantasy that you've outplayed people have what second alternative? To not work, do whatever they want (chores, look after the kids, groceries) and further their educations to end up where exactly? Back in a new role working 8 hours per day?

I work 8.5 hours per day. I get out mountain biking a couple times per week in the summer, I'm constantly developing my educational interests, I have time for beers with friends on weekdays, I have a dog, I am on an extra curricular advisory board, I play video games, watch the latest series, shovel my walk, change my own oil, etc etc etc. You're so full of shit that people can't do other things. Yeah, we'd all like more free time, hell I'd like INFINITE free time to scrap work altogether. That's the reality of life. Retirement is a new concept, people used to work themselves to the bone. The eight hour workday is a reduction from labour standards decades ago where 10-12 hours was more common. If anything needs to change its the length of the workday and the percentage of corporate revenue that goes to the employees, not a larger and thicker social security system to be mismanaged and misused. You're absolutely right that you won't change my mind, not until you or somebody else comes up with a logical justification for handing out free money to those that don't need it rather than addressing fundamental societal norms and directly supporting impoverished people instead.",hrgg4cp,t3_rwpr9w,1641448009,1641473209.0,/r/alberta/comments/rwpr9w/what_are_your_thoughts_on_universal_basic_income/hrgg4cp/,2022-01-06 05:46:49,2022-01

If you're going to tax people with modest jobs who have invested into their registered accounts and paid off their home, plenty of hard working average joes and jills will have a 7-figure net worth by middle age.

The taxation would have to be based on salary. But wait a minute - CEOs don't earn millions of dollars - they might make 200-300k, and the rest of their compensation is stocks. Do you start taxing unrealized gains on non-registered accounts only? Maybe, right?  U dunno, this is the part I've never understood.

I DO know, however that there is NEVER one side to a story; there is YOUR side, THEIR side, and somewhere in the middle, lies the Truth. I'm also disabled, due to cancer. by my own admission, I'm an irascible, grumpy old man; for every person who likes or loves me, you'd likely find a dozen who'd run me over if they thought they could get away with it.

YOU are responsible for YOU, in ALL things. Why did you get fired from so many jobs? I KNOW it wasn't Just because of medical reasons. Our society doesn't work that way; it is ILLEGAL to terminate someone for medical reasons. There is a duty to accommodate; what did YOU do, or not do, that gave them grounds to terminate you?

30,Magneon,ontario,"I actually wrote my MPP about this earlier today. Her staff sent me back a Twitter clip of her speaking out against the bill recently, so it was preaching to the choir. The gist of my message was this:

- Nurses in Canada now take the same exam as Americans nurses (since around 2010), making it a lot easier to work in the states. My sister graduated nursing last spring and works in the US. So we're losing new grads.

- My wife stayed home for the past few years, but is a licensed non practicing RN with ONA. If she went back now, she'd make a bit less than she did 6 years ago, adjusted for inflation, but the conditions that contributed to her stepping away from the profession are worse.

- COVID is more dangerous to older nurses, leading to early retirement waves as we've seen.

So there we have it. They're burning the candle and both ends, and then decided to try and light the middle on fire when they were at it.

Finally, there's this bill. The province can either bar nurses from striking, or legislate wage caps. By doing both, they're abusing their legislative power and operating in brazen bad faith. This is a profession that already attracts a large number of caring and self sacrificing people, then ruthlessly takes advantage of them. To have the province pile on top of that, all the while thanking the ""heros"" for their sacrifice is sickening. 

A lot of what I said here applies to a dozen other professions who work similarly hard in medicine. You know it's bad when doctors are taking stress leave, once you account for what our medical schools and residence programs select for.

No it isn't and it happens to be accurate. You only have to look at the last provincial election to see proof. Ford was a shit candidate then and he won a majority plus he's only gotten worse. 

&gt;Older individuals generally vote conservative not 

I didn't say anything about older individuals. That was somebody else. All I referred to was conservative voters. People of all ages vote conservative, especially in rural areas.

&gt;because it's how they've always voted but because it's fiscally responsible. 

You're assuming that all voters make intelligent choices based on logic and facts. History keeps proving that they don't. Studies have shown that a lot of people vote based on little more than name recognition.

&gt;They have more to lose to inflation and social program propaganda than younger voters. Like their life savings to inflation and any kind of semblance of comfortable retirement. 

Like I said many voters don't use logic to decide who they're voting for. Look at how all those people who voted for a buck a beer. That's their real priority. Bread and circuses.

&gt;Current government is not doing a great job on economy at all at the moment,

No shit, Sherlock.

&gt;but liberals historically have put economy in enormous risk.

So maybe it's time to vote for somebody other than the Liberals or the Conservatives.

51,EveMB,alberta,"Official restrictions: in theory not many. But in practice, my life is unrecognizable.

However when I was planning my retirement in pre-plague times, I envisioned a life of what I call “libraries and coffee shops”. With some galleries, museums and theatre on the side. I’m not really into shopping and can’t afford pubs anymore. Unfortunately, I retired in May 2020 when the world suddenly contracted.

What I have found is that there are very few coffee shops where one can sit with an ebook for half an hour or an hour. (I’m not one to sit for four hours with a single cup of coffee.) Coffee shops tend to be takeout only. One of the places I had planned to to hang out is the Second Cup at the ATB/Telus tower basement. But all the tables are now ribboned off and the hours are severely reduced. Second Cups (including my favorite at College Plaza) are either closed entirely or takeout only.

Libraries have been closed for longer than other businesses but are admittedly open now. I’m going to the Stanley Milner again tomorrow to give it a second chance. (First try was less than ideal.) My first choice in the before times were the University libraries. But those are closed to me for January because I’m not a UAlberta students. I’m an Athabasca U student and in the before times the Rutherford was a second home (my third place).

As to museums and such, it was never my style to rush through an exhibit. I can happily sit in front of a particular work for half an hour to an hour. This is not compatible with making an appointment for an hour-block of time. And my visits are part of a random walk. I’ll wait until that becomes normal.

I was looking forward, post work, to being able to attend those public lectures that happened during day hours. That has completely shut down for the last year and a half and for an indeterminate future. (I tried Zoom lectures and they’re not the same. I prefer YouTube.)

Hear me out.  You need a ride over your head, right?  You have one!  You can't afford a house so you rent... Logical, sensible.  If you find another job in another town, one months notice and you're free to move!

Imagine if you owned a house, and the same situation occurred.  Well, now you gotta sell.  But before you can do that, you gotta find a realtor, who has to market your place, and you have to keep your place looking like you don't live there for the whole time is on the market.  If your new job starts on a couple of weeks, well, you have to text and look for a new house.  Party commissions on your new place.  And don't forget fees and land transfer tax.  Oh, and how you can sell your old place within six months of buying your new place, or the government will slap you with a empty house tax.

You have to break your mortgage, and pay a fee.  Then you have to get another mortgage and pay those fees.

If the water heater or anything goes wrong, yep those are on you to fix prior to closing.  Hope you told the new owner all the problems in your place, cause of you didn't, they could sue you for non-disclosure.

Rent.  It's cheaper, gives you flexibility, and you can save ask that money and build up a retirement nest egg so maybe you don't have to work till you're 75 just to retire on dog food and crackers.

Wait till the interest rates go up, and all these people who maximized their borrowing capacity are screwed and underwater are forced to sell.  Swoop in and vultch then.  You will get your house dirt cheap, have a ton of cash in the bank to boot.

The whole country is unaffordable for most of its citizens - it doesn't matter where you move, the average micro condo/mobile/townhome/duplex/small home starts at $499 - if you are lucky. Then there is a strata for most unable to access higher funding for a home on private land. The Strata can be 200-800 extra on top of that 499 mortgages. Now even if someone dumps an impressive nest egg on a unit of 100k, it's still a large mortgage to carry. It's not that op shouldn't buy, or that they should move to where there funds could carry further - there isn't that option because jobs might not be available to carry the rest of that mortgage - the issue is Canada has a massive housing crisis, rates are unaffordable and it's recognized globally...I'm surprised it's own citizens ignore it. And also, I find your empathy lacking regarding medical. I bet you have no idea how close people are all the time of not being able to afford prescriptions, parking at the cancer clinic, dental, toilet paper even. My point is that rates for homes and bidding wars are creating a equity problem that isn't solved by not buying or moving. Rent is often more money then a monthly mortgage. Where diwn the road is this person supposed to buy if value jumps 23% each year. How do they make 23% more money to even that out.

Don't get me started on how 2 years into a pandemic we have a solid goose egg on increased capacity in Healthcare or alternative measures to dealing with this pandemic. I'm not a conspiracy guy at all, but talk about fueling the fire for our tinfoil hat group, how can we be spending so much money on pandemic relief but nothing going to securing more Healthcare workers or add icu beds. I know several nurse that have quit and found different jobs outside of Healthcare. I also noticed that DoFo has done nothing about the retirement homes that are basically a 3rd world country for our elderly.

92,Immortal385,ontario," Posted: Aug 24, 2021
Critical care nurses in southern Ontario have reached a breaking point after they say more than a year and a half of brutal pandemic work and stagnant pay has led to a staffing shortage so severe they believe it's putting patients in danger. 

And as the fourth wave begins, with the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario hitting 639 on Monday, they say they don't know how they or their hospitals will cope.

CBC News agreed to give four nurses anonymity so they could talk freely about the conditions at their hospitals. All of them said they'd face severe retribution from management for speaking out without permission. 

""I have no doubt I'd be fired,"" said a Toronto nurse who's worked in the emergency department for more than 20 years.

But she said she can't stay silent any longer. 

""The anxiety that I feel before having to go back to work because I don't know what I'm going to see or how many people I'm going to have to take care of because we're short staffed ... I am sometimes terrified,"" she said. 

She is behind the Instagram account @nursewithsign416, which shares images of nurses, their families and other health professionals holding signs describing the importance of experienced nurses and how burned out they are, along with the hashtag #RNsilentnomore.  

Many of the posts are demanding Premier Doug Ford's government repeal Bill 124, 2019 legislation that capped annual salary increases for many public sector employees, including nurses, at an average of one per cent annually for three years.

The Ministry of Health said it has recently announced $61 million in funding to train, recruit and hire thousands of registered and practical nurses. The province also provided nurses with a four-month pandemic pay salary top-up in 2020 and is working to provide mental health support for front-line health-care workers.

""Our government is incredibly grateful for the contributions of Ontario's health care workers and the critical role they have played throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, providing patients with timely, safe and equitable access to high quality care,"" said ministry spokesperson David Jensen. 

Jensen said it's ""inaccurate"" to suggest Bill 124, which applies to nurses, teachers and many other public sector employees, caps wage increases at one per cent a year as they can still get raises for seniority and performance. 

The nursing shortage is absolutely brutal ... and the impact on patients and their families and health-care providers is very real.
- Dr. Raghu Venugopal, Toronto emergency physician
The Toronto nurse said that while she's at the top of the pay scale, her one per cent raise has translated to 47 cents an hour, even though she's doing the most dangerous and stressful work of her career.

She said she's watched other first responders, including local police and most recently the RCMP, get significantly higher raises, and questioned why her colleagues aren't getting the same.

""You can't call us heroes on the one hand and then pay us back for it with 47 cents,"" she said. 

This year alone, she said dozens of nurses have left her emergency department because they're burned  out, underpaid and ignored by hospitals and the province.

Nursing shortages impacting patient care, say doctors
Two doctors who've worked alongside the Toronto nurse and support her campaign told CBC News they've seen emergency departments close entire wings because there's not enough nurses to attend those beds, meanwhile acute patients wait on stretchers in hallways.

Dr. Raghu Venugopal, a Toronto emergency physician, said he's seen three nurses care for up to 25 patients at a time. On a recent shift, he witnessed a man have a seizure without any privacy while other patients, including a small child, watched in shock.

""The nursing shortage is absolutely brutal,"" he said. ""I can't emphasize enough how serious the situation is in acute health care right now. And the impact on patients and their families and health-care providers is very real."" 

Dr. Christopher Keefer, another Toronto emergency physician, said there's a sense of despair and frustration among his colleagues.

""We've lost so many great nurses because they just can't take it anymore,"" Keefer said. ""I see nurses crying at work all the time. To see these incredibly strong people be broken, it's very hard."" 


A key concern raised by the Instagram account — and the Ontario Nurses' Association — is the number of experienced critical care nurses who are leaving their jobs and can't be replaced with new hires. (nursewithasign416/Instagram)
The Ontario Hospital Association spokesperson Hannah Ward said it's been working closely with hospitals, colleges and universities to understand the pandemic's impact on health-care staff and to rebuild the workforce. 

""Dedicated and highly skilled health care workers continue to go above and beyond the call of duty under these extraordinary circumstances,"" Ward said. ""And hospitals are grateful to them as they do everything in their power to protect and care for Ontarians."" 

'It feels very heavy'
Another nurse, who works in a Hamilton hospital, said her intensive care unit has lost a third of its full-time nurses. On several occasions, she said she's worked when the department is short 10 nurses or more — about half the staff needed. Some have been replaced with recent graduates who, she said, aren't equipped to work in critical care. 

""It feels very heavy when you're getting ready to go in,"" she said. ""We sleep awful the night before our first shift because there's this impending dread of what am I going back into tomorrow."" 

Nurses are leaving their jobs as COVID cases surge and wildfires burn in B.C.'s Interior
Ontario nursing groups fear mass exodus from workforce following pandemic burnout
The two other nurses who work at different hospitals described similar situations in their units, with dozens of experienced colleagues having left in the past six months. One of the nurses is now on leave because of the stress she said she experienced during the first and second waves of the pandemic. 

Hospitals currently face a 10 to 12 per cent vacancy rate for nursing positions, estimated Ontario Nurses' Association President Vicki McKenna. And while recent nursing graduates are being hired in droves, the province is not doing enough to retain experienced nurses who are essential to critical care units. 

""They feel disposable, disrespected and not acknowledged,"" she said. 

The union has called for the province to change Bill 124 so nurses can be paid at least the cost of inflation, but has only been met with silence, said McKenna.

Working within the confines of Bill 124, Toronto's University Health Network, where none of the nurses in this story work, is finding other ways to retain nurses as many near retirement age, said Terri Stuart-McEwan, executive director of surgical services and a registered nurse. 

""Can we provide them with educational initiatives? Can we give them great schedules? Can we treat them with respect? All of those things,"" she said. ""For our staff, recognition and empowerment seems way more important sometimes than just money in the bank.""",hr0q408,t3_ruof3n,1641176617,1641201817.0,/r/ontario/comments/ruof3n/is_everyone_aware_the_posts_of_the_nursing/hr0q408/,2022-01-03 02:23:37,2022-01

Hugh McRoberts established a dairy farm in the area of Surrey now known as Royal Heights and was instrumental in building the North Arm Road. This road formed the route for what is now Southwest Marine Drive in Vancouver. McRoberts also served on the city council of New Westminster and on the Hospital Board. Hugh McRoberts continued to serve his community until his passing in 1883. This school was named in honour of the legacy he left as one of the pioneers of the city.""*
* **Matthew McNair Secondary School**
   * From school website: ""*The school is named after Matthew McNair (1889 to 1971), a pioneer farmer and businessman who, in 1911, settled in Richmond where he established a milk delivery service. After serving in World War I, he bought some acreage in south Richmond.  As well, he served as municipal Councillor from 1946 to 1948 and on the Boards of the Potato Growers’ Association, Richmond Kiwanis, and the local Board of Trade.""*
* **McMath Secondary School**
   * From Wikipedia: *""Named in honour of Robert Alexander McMath (1915-1996). McMath served with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada during the Second World War. In 1951, McMath was elected as a school trustee in the city of Richmond, and from 1957 until his retirement in 1993 he served on Richmond's Municipal Council.""*

He began teaching English at Bridgeport School, and when Richmond Secondary was opened in 1928, he became its first principal, a position which he held until 1959. After 1959, he held the post of Director of Secondary Instruction until he retired in 1968. Forty-three years as an educator in the Richmond School District is a feat in itself.""*

97,true_nexus,ontario,"Yep. 

I can tell you that this surge will be entirely different from the previous waves due to a lack of staffing to handle such things.  There's the obvious that we've heard about ""burn out"" and ""retirement"" among nurses but, as my wife is an RPN in Durham Region, I can tell you that there's also a number of RN's and SA's that have said ""Fuck this shit... I'm heading to the U.S. where the pay is better"" - they're of the opinion that if they're going to be put through the meat grinder, they may as well make it worth their while. 

So there's staffing issues and only so many doctors, nurses (of all sorts) and affiliated staff to tackle not just these patients but all the rest that show up at the hospitals.  

And this government has done what to assist?  Pass a bill limiting the pay for these workers.  Ask them to ""volunteer"" their time when they've been working back to back shifts.  It's no wonder so many have decided to take a similar attitude to the provincial government that the provincial government has taken towards them.",hqy4o0t,t3_ruc2y7,1641140313,1641165513.0,/r/ontario/comments/ruc2y7/ontario_jan_02_16714_cases_16_deaths_icus_224_19/hqy4o0t/,2022-01-02 16:18:33,2022-01
98,deuceawesome,ontario,"&gt; I mean do you really believe that people were better off in 1980? Basically every metric of wealth has increased since then from average dwelling size, poverty rates, car ownership, access to technology and consumer goods, increases in recreational travel, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think life was better in 1980 than today you need to look closer at how people actually lived in 1980.

I debate this one all the time and still dont have the answer.

This was all pre free trade with the US. We had a booming manufacturing sector with good paying, union jobs for just about anyone who wanted them. Some ""stuff"" cost more (electronics, clothing) than they do now, as input costs were higher before we outsourced everything to ....well, cheaper emerging economies.

Housing prices were less, but the interest rates were high, meaning the monthly payment was comparable to recently (before the real estate bubble) 

My parents bought there place in 1979 for $12,000. Today its worth 700k.

My parents retirement plan? Sell the house, downsize, and bank away the money and live off the interest.

Well, that plan never happened. They are leary of the stock markets and normal bank accounts and GIC's pay fuck all. So they still live there, not sure what to do.

......back to then vs now; a brand new car lasted five years during the ""malaise era"" (1974-84), whereas now getting 20 years out of a vehicle is not unheard of. You would have to sit down and really crunch the numbers. I still don't know if it was better than then now or not.

Im a gold bug. My dad a real estate bull. We crunched the numbers on that one, if he had of bought gold instead of the house with the same amount of money.....it actually worked out to being pretty close to the same value today.

Anyways, food for thought. Good middle class wages and more expensive crap, or what we have now. My first computer in 1989, parents bought it for us, was $3000. I kept it for a laugh (well, the tower anyways)",hqxzsfy,t3_rtvclw,1641138237,1641163437.0,/r/ontario/comments/rtvclw/parents_first_grocery_bill_from_1982_ottawa/hqxzsfy/,2022-01-02 15:43:57,2022-01

My house went crazy in the lower mainland, so we cashed out and bought a nice place in your area. I feel dirty accepting the amount of money for our house, but we worked on this place since we bought it 11 years ago and figure it's time to relax. In a few weeks, I'll be mortgage free, put a bit away for retirement and pad the kids college funds. The house is big enough for my dad to move in as well, so he gets to retire finally. I never thought I'd be able to give my family or my father this kind of opportunity. I'm still kind of in shock that this is happening.

I'm hopeful the blind bids and the house flipping tax will chill out the market.

I don't think it's necessary as the CPP is one of the better managed funds in our country at current levels and shows no indication of needing more money. This is a tax on young, working class people just to appease the retiring boomers demanding more money that they didn't contribute to the fund themselves, and I don't support it on that basis.

Most teachers only ever access the 11 days at 100% pay and the vast majority don't use it all. The bankable days system was designed as a deterrent to taking days off and saved the ON government a lot of money as very few supplies were hired (when compared to the period after). While teachers were paid out for that time, it was at an amount that was less per day than the cost of the supply teachers (i.e. it is more costly now without bankable days). However, the idea fell to the crabs in the bucket mentality. My fathe-in-law for example, only missed 1 day of work in 32 years as a teacher.

113,JustWhateverForever,ontario,"I have a lot of dislike of the Ontario Hospitals Association, but to their credit, they have been pretty vocal about how bad things are; in a way we've never seen before (working conditions were also crap pre-pandemic which at the time they would vehemently deny, at least now they're on the same side as healthcare workers instead of the side of the government).  


The problem is at this point, what the fuck could the government even do to improve working conditions? There just aren't nurses to hire, because decades of austerity and mismanagement by all three parties have devastated our nursing workforce. No thanks to Ford, but at the beginning of the pandemic EVERYONE was trying to pull together to make things work- people were working overtime, nurses were coming out of retirement, 4th year RN students and 2nd year RPN students were graduated early, there was a legitimate surge. But that was a short term solution, you can't rely on your workforce doing 60 hour weeks for two years.   


(Small) credit to the government that they have started to make some changes with PSE to graduate more nurses/PSWs, there's new funding for nursing students to take paid roles in hospitals, its becoming easier for internationally trained nurses to practice in Ontario, and we're spending more on upskilling nurses in critical care and perioperative to address the backlog of surgeries we'll be catching up from over the next decade. Its both not enough and also too much for colleges and universities to handle the scale up, but its the type of long term thinking about healthcare we haven't had in Ontario since like, the 1970s.

119,The_BBQFishSticks,ontario,"Staying generic on purpose. My sister in law is a surgeon, at one od Toronto's hospitals. Her field of expertise is women's health related. She has not been on the COVID/ICU frontlines due to the fact there is no one to replace her expertise.

I asked her over our family Christmas get together how's it going, considering what some of us are hearing in the general public.

From her perspective her hospital and her department are running at around a -10% staffing for the last half of the year. She sees a double wammy of staff at retirement age leaving stacked on top of extra-COVID-fatigue burnout exits from nursing. She said it is common to see nursing turnover, its a rough job that some just can't do after being in it but exits are way more common with the pressure of always being asked to do more.

What's making things really difficult is COVID. For 2 years medical schools and colleges are running lean, not able to keep eductaing enough doctors and nurses near pre-2020 levels ++ if her or any of her team test positive for COVID, the entire team is out for a mandatory 14 day quarantine, meaning another doctor and their team needs to pick up that extra slack for 2 weeks (see staff burnout above).

While she's fully aware of the dangers of COVID, this quarantine policy doesn't make any sense to her. Medical staff can protect themselves and work with COVID positive patients, even in ICU's without getting sick, but are blocked from doing their jobs reversing the order, and because 1 team member tests positive? Yes COVID is dangerous nad has been deadly but for the doctor in my family, even she says the vast majority of positive COVID cases are not serious, especially now with so many people vaccinated and for my sister in law, her and her entire team was double vaxxed early on in 2021.",hqrp2mv,t3_rt7bt9,1641009951,1641035151.0,/r/ontario/comments/rt7bt9/doctorsnurses_of_ontario_what_is_the_inside/hqrp2mv/,2022-01-01 04:05:51,2022-01
120,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt;Harris has profited a lot from his part time boardroom-based job with Chartwell. According to the Toronto Star, he was paid $229,500 last year.

&gt;The Star also reports that ""Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) – including $4.29 million in 'deferred trust units' (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement)."" According to the article Chartwell's communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell's homes. ""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it's ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell's corporate boardroom while front line workers in homes are paid ""abysmal, poverty wages.""

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors' homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

161,acdqnz,NovaScotia,"The pension is a fixed amount, not indexed like the feds. It is calculated including CPP, so the amount of pension after 35yrs of work is ~$45k/year. 

your pay check is deducted a significant amount, which is around 10% of your salary at that salary level. Now if you did employee matching of 5% day with your company, and also contributed an additional 5% your whole career, plus CPP, you may not be far off. Making $80k a year, would you save $1000/month? That would be a total of $1400… give. You could easily amass $1M+ in savings with that, and that could give you a similar payment. The key component is *could*

It’s just that it’s guaranteed, so the lack of worrying about it, or how long you live after retirement isn’t a worry, is a real benefit. I’ll give you that. But they give up a lot of hope to do better in life. It’s a trade off in my opinion. But what if they die 3 years after retirement? A non-pensioner will be able to give the entire amount to their family. The pensioner cannot - in most cases the pension is automatically cut in half

The truth is most people are not disciplined enough. And the contractual guarantee assures that future.

162,Yousa_Dumass,ontario,"My aunt was always an independent person. She continued to live alone and manage her own affairs even after her husband died. She was always close to my mom because they were a product of divorce and their mother died when they were about 10 or 12.

I had seen a decline in my aunt for quite a few years. Gradual…. she’d began to forget things, and repeat things, etc. I told my mom that we need to plan things, but my mom was in denial. I told my mom that my aunt needs to get checked but my aunt refused because she thought her doctor was “stupid”. My aunt lived in Ottawa… so I didn’t see her on a regular basis. I never probed deeply into her affairs because I didn’t want to be perceived as a vulture looking to take her cash.

Things came to a head a few years ago when my mom handed me a letter that my aunt received. She hadn’t paid the property tax on her condo in more than 3 years and the city was starting the process of listing it for sale. That’s when I got involved and started investigating things and found out the true extent of the disaster. Not only did she owe property taxes, but she hadn’t filed her income tax for years and she had been withdrawing heavily from all her retirement funds and getting all these tax penalties. By the time I got a picture of things she only had about $2000 left in all her investment funds and owed about another $50k in various credit cards. She was making cash withdrawals from her investment accounts in $5000 increments but she couldn’t explain where the cash went other than to say she was using it to pay bills. I couldn’t understand what all the credit card debt was about because it’s not like she had a lot of stuff and the stuff she had was old. I suspect she was making cash withdrawals. It’s pretty clear she was getting scammed by someone. I suspect that it was somebody in the condo that she lived at. In the end, after her condo was sold and all her debts and bills were paid she cleared about $45k.

If we as a family had gotten involved earlier I’m sure that my aunt’s financial situation would be better and she could have stayed in a private facility longer. But it’s a difficult line to walk between being concerned and being perceived as being out to get someone’s money. 

I visit her once in a while… not sure what to expect when I go there. A lot of the times she doesn’t remember that my mom is dead and asks why I didn’t bring my mom… other times she acts as if everything is normal… and sometimes she’s convinced I sold her condo and stole the money from her and exiled her to the nursing home to hide my crimes.",hq0o0dx,t3_rnvk3o,1640520647,1640545847.0,/r/ontario/comments/rnvk3o/family_burnout_leads_to_granny_dumping_especially/hq0o0dx/,2021-12-26 12:10:47,2021-12

My aunt has early onset dementia. She had been living in a private retirement home for about a year and a half before it was decided to pull her out and have her stay temporarily with my mom in order to save money while waiting for her to get into a long term care facility.  My aunt has  been a widower for the past 15 years and has no kids. 

Fast forward 2 months later and my mom passes away and my aunt then becomes a priority to get a bed in a long term care home. The case worker tells me that it will be a month or two before this happens and the decision was that she comes to stay with me while waiting .

Fast forward 7 months later and she still doesn’t have a bed.  Meanwhile my aunt has become more abusive towards the family and my family relationship is beginning to fall apart. My wife is at wits end and my kids live in fear. My aunt would smear shit on the walls of her bedroom, walk around with no pants or underwear on because she said it was hot, start crawling on the ground because she said her back was broken, complain that we were mistreating her and start alleging that we were stealing from her. 

Final straw came when the PSW came one day and found a butchers knife hidden in her closet. When asked about it my aunt first said she was using it to cut up vegetables to eat, then she said she needed it as protection.

I dropped her off at the emergency room the next day. Meanwhile the hospital and social workers call me up almost daily telling me that they have assessed her and she is ok and that they want me to take her back while waiting for a bed to be available… which of course will be any week now. I refuse to take her back.

Fast forward a week later they are suddenly able to find her a bed.

If that 20 something single person or even one half of a couple is responsible for looking after a high needs elderly parent - let alone two sets of them like we had - there is no way they are saving for retirement AND providing a great quality of life for any kids.   

Even if someone doesn’t work and stays home, financially it’s a setback and it’s a shit job  for whoever stays home to wipe granny’s arse and listen to her rip the closet apart again and babble 24-7.   

There is no break.  Dementia patients wander, they are up at all hours.   They strip their clothes off.  They diddle themselves.  They fall.

At least nursing home staff get paid, work in teams and can clock out and get vacation or quit and can use nursing supports and medications.  They are no paid or recognized enough.  Not nearly enough.

As a caregiver to two generations, I have seen and done things for a grandparent/ parent /in-laws that no kid should have to see or do.  My parents prepared the best they could for the future but the cost of care and nursing homes is out of reach for average families, even with planning.  I spent 13k on extra care for my father just in his last month of life.  Just so I could sleep. 

Affordable daycare is great, we should have that too, but people really can choose to consider their economic and mental condition before having more kids and save up before they have more than they can support.

maintain a very good conversation... why, because they wanted to ?

They deliver food to her apartment door and she doesn't interact with anyone. She can't watch TV. She can't read. We send her books on CD but she goes through them so fast that she's run out of new books. My parents live on the other side of the country and we have spent 4 days with them over the past 2 years.

We were going to surprise my parents by having my sister and her family fly in. In this house only the bedrooms are enclosed, everything else is open air.

In the past business paid a hell of a lot more to society in taxes and created millionaires and billionaires (of the time along the way)… even at times where there was a 90% income tax rate on the wealthy.

Now corporate taxes in Canada are in the low to mid 20% range and that’s both federal and provincial combined… yet they’re cutting pension plans, cutting benefits and cutting staff even though most of them are more profitable than ever… or have been prior to covid.

BCE is an example. A working in 1970 got an entire pension, defined benefit, without even contributing one cent to it… in 1970. BCE is more profitable now and they’ve gone from zero pay DB plans to shared cost DB plans to now Defined Contribution plans… where your pension has zero guarantees for your loyalty and hard work for the company in retirement. Again, they’re more profitable now than they ever were and the corporate tax rates have dropped since Mulroney (federally) by over 60%… 60% cut in tax obligations. Similar cuts have happened provincially.

I know this BCE stat because my mom was on of those workers from the 70’s that literally paid zero into her pension that she’s collected with a buyout package since age 50. Yeah, they even retired her early at 50, with a lump sum and full health insurance until she dies.

&gt; Can you please outline what changes in provincial and municipal legislation happened to cause this 4x increase in the pace of growth? I can tell you what federal policies changed.

Nothing. That's the issue. For 20 years cities have been refusing to rezone from say an R4 or R6 up to R8 or higher so high density housing can be made.

Finally in 2015 as you put it, the issue started to grow exponentially thanks to the supply slowly starting to creep into dangerously low levels and 2015 is almost exactly when the economy finally returned to levels before the 2009 recession that hit Canada fairly hard.

http://teachingwithdata.blogspot.com/2010/09/worst-recession-since-great-depression.html

This sparked a mass accumulation of homes via boomers and other investors looking to not risk the stock market again for retirement. Couple with the small but modest 5% foreign investments purchased has caused this mess.


So it's not anyone's fault. Should the current government do more? Probably, but realistically I don't blame them. I blame the bank of canada for refusing to correct interest rates sooner causing the current issues we have today.


So again, it's not 80% anyone's problem... It's an incredibly complex issue that your coffee time problem solving isn't going to fix. Maybe grow the fuck up and understand that the world isn't black and white, and a single person can't fix your problems or cause them

221,MattHooper1975,ontario,"**Help!**

Either my brain is broken, or the Toronto covid information website is trying to break it by forcing me to accept logical contradictions!

I have a family member who has tested positive for covid, making me a close contact. (Though we are isolating).

I want to find the current rules for self isolation for close contacts who are double vaccinated.

Going to the Toronto information page:

**COVID-19: What to Do if You Are a Close Contact**

[https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-what-you-should-do/covid-19-what-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact/](https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-what-you-should-do/covid-19-what-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact/)

&amp;#x200B;

First paragraph says:

*If you are identified as a close contact of someone infected with the*   
*COVID-19 Omicron variant, you will have to self-isolate even if you are*   
*fully vaccinated.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Yet ALL the subsequent details and information says you DO NOT have to self isolate IF you are fully vaccinated!**

Under ""how to know if you are a close contact:

*If you are identified as a close contact of someone who has COVID-19 you*  
 *will need to self-isolate, UNLESS you are fully vaccinated or you have*   
*had a recent COVID-19 infection.*

&amp;#x200B;

The next section is titled:

**Self-Isolate IF you are not fully vaccinated..**..

and says: *""If you are fully vaccinated or have had a recent COVID-19 infection, you*  
 *may not need to self-isolate. Please read the information for fully vaccinated close contacts and close contacts with a recent COVID-19 infection below if you think this may apply to you.*

Ok, so I read that section and it says:

&amp;#x200B;

*If you meet the definition for being fully vaccinated or having a*   
*recent COVID-19 infection, you still must self-isolate if any of the*   
*following apply:*

  
*If you have symptoms related to COVID-19;If you are immunocompromised;If you are a resident at a long-term care or retirement homeIf you are a hospital inpatientIf you have been otherwise instructed to self-isolate by Toronto Public Health*

  
*If none of the above apply, you are not required to self-isolate.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Well...none of the above apply to me or others in the family.**

**Which indicates we don't have to self isolate.**

**Which is in contradiction to the first paragraph of the web page.**

Why?

Because the students she ran into in all the common areas refused to wear masks. They were sitting in crowded lounges with masks down and basically flaunting the rules intended to not only keep them safe; but others as well. My mother isn’t young, she’s nearing retirement and is worried for her health and whether or not her environment might make her carry COVID to my ailing grandparents. 

According to her the students just don’t care anymore. And while I’m sure there’s exceptions, I believe it. She says the students are frustrated there’s no staff at the University, meanwhile the university is letting people work from home because they refuse to properly enforce safety measures to keep staff safe. 

The catch is, students have a responsibility to be safe for themselves and others. Their status as students doesn’t grant them any kind of special treatment. 

When my mother, an incredibly thick skinned woman who’s endured a lot over her life calls me crying and wanting to know what her legal avenues are because she feels unsafe due to the students not following some pretty basic rules, I don’t feel so bad for some of those students.",hos2qgr,t3_rh5ce4,1639662577,1639687777.0,/r/ontario/comments/rh5ce4/ontario_universities_moving_classes_online_in/hos2qgr/,2021-12-16 13:49:37,2021-12

People just want a stable, good income that provides them the cost of living an enjoyable life with a future outlook of being able to save comfortably for retirement and the ability to build up some personal wealth. That should be the ideal and is for many people. Watching executives/owners and higher management earn at a rate many multitudes higher than employees is a big part of the issue. It’s definitely something that needs to be repaired.  Yet you see the major stakeholders of companies trying to fight against minimum wage increases which by the way are reactive pay increases not proactive.  The single mother making 15 dollars an hour doesn’t really need the added stress in her life worrying about losing her shitty job from her shitty manager because she’s deemed expendable if her pay is forced to increase to 18 or 20 dollars per hour.  Protesting to those at the top of the so called food chain, who by the way are extremely insulated against the average person’s struggles, is one way some can feel like their voice can be heard.  So big fucking deal if people think raises to match real estate and subsequent rent increases will help solve the issues. It’s not necessarily the correct way to solve the issue but it’s at a point where it’s totally understandable and relatable by so many.

231,confusedbytrees,saskatchewan,"I agree with things getting worse, much worse, throughout this pandemic. 

I disagree with the trend in this post, shitting on others' opinions when divergent from their own. Although I am not surprised, as there was/is a lot of infighting amongst these helping professions.

Very few aspects in life have a singular cause- please keep this in mind before blaming only management, or those colleagues who are 'abusing' time off, etc.

I can speak to out-of scope positions that got their portfolio quadrupled since SHA. QUADRUPLED. As in four times the workload, but the pay started almost the same, and most importantly there's an expectation that this 1 person can somehow do what they used to do, plus what 3 others did!?!

I can also speak about people who take more time off because they just can't handle others' problems anymore, or their home life got to a point where something had to give. And then get blamed by their own colleagues for not doing their part. Mental health is not a given, and is not constant. Health workers, more so than other professions, were/are wrongly expected to somehow know how to take care of themselves.

If we learned anything, I hope it's that everyone makes mistakes. Some have an easier time than others recognizing their missteps. SHA was/is a huge process to undertake, and yes, mistakes are expected. Then the pandemic hit at the worst possible time.

Overfocusing just on mistakes doesn't lead to a better future though, this is the recipe for bitterness, rumination, and extremism.I also hope that overfocusing on one issue, be it an important one (COVID), is recognized as a mistake. Forcing front line workers to do something they're not trained for, forcing period, is what should not have happened, and what sent many to early retirement, less work, etc. I'm afraid though that no lessons were learned at the political level. 

TL;DR: there's a systemic issue, with a huge restructuring process, during a pandemic, multiple levels of management that do not reflect front line realities, political influence on something that should be based on science and front line experience/knowledge, union issues too.

280,bsbbtnh,ontario,"There's a meme that millennials can't afford homes because they buy avocado toast and coffee. It largely stems from [this Aussie millionaire](https://twitter.com/60Mins/status/864065346516377600), though his point wasn't so much about them spending money on avocados, but in the shift in culture from people like him, who worked, sacrificed, and saved to get their first home, to people of today who want to work less, save less, and spend money for a better lifestyle now. Also, this is in the context of the Australian housing market, and he's not saying that millennials or whoever should stop buying avocados or start working 90+ hours, he's saying that there needs to be something done to make housing more affordable.

Anyways, around the time he said that (and the years leading up) many financial 'gurus' or w/e, they usually focused their advice on cutting unnecessary expenses, to help people save money for retirement or a down payment. A common thing was citing the cost of a cup of coffee from starbucks, multiplying that by the number of work days, calculating how much interest you'd get off it, etc.

Lots of people (who probably cannot afford starbucks) bitch about financial advice like this, because it isn't tailored to them. Poor people don't need financial advice, though.

Brockville has the highest rate of overdose in Ontario. There are rent cities all around due to a very large homeless population and there are no amenities for anyone under 65. It’s a retirement town for the old.

Cornwall is a dead beat city that has been dying a slow death since the late 90s.

It’s biggest problem is that it is sandwiched between the US border crossing and Quebec which tends to attract the worst of both.

Johnston and Prescot are empty shells with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Both have huge problems with human trafficking and drug runners. Run down buildings and homes with panhandlers frequenting the streets are a common feature.

288,adolphehuttler,ontario,"You're quite right. Hospitals did everything they could to cope with the flood of Covid patients. What this person refuses to acknowledge is that increasing ICU capacity means increasing the number of *trained staff*. You can add all the beds, machines in wards you want, but without sufficient staff, there is literally no point. Training new ICU nurses, doctors and other support staff (e.g. respiratory therapists) takes *years*. And a significant percentage of existing staff have burned out, quit or taken early retirement because they were worked to the bone during the pandemic. 

ICU staff right now are not overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, thankfully, but they are burdened with a huge backlog of surgeries and other procedures requiring ICU care because these were delayed during the worst of the infection waves. At the same time, capacity has suffered from staff attrition, meaning ICU staff are still working their asses off. Being an ICU nurse is a very unattractive job at the moment, so we're unlikely to see a recovery in staff numbers over the next few years. Expanding capacity in the long term means enticing more people to become ICU staff, which means increasing their pay and (perhaps more importantly) improving their work conditions.

309,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt;Far from introducing reform, Ontario is enshrining the status quo. The majority of long-term-care licenses are being awarded to the for-profit companies that had higher COVID death rates than their non-profit and municipal counterparts. Overall, 16,304 out of a total of 30,436 long-term-care licenses are to be awarded to for-profit providers, a Ontario Health Council report notes.

&gt;It’s impossible not to take all this personally. The scene is being set, now, for the type of facilities that will exist for three more decades. Chances are excellent that I’ll be dead long before 2051, but there’s also a chance that I, and my older friends, might need 24-hour institutional care before we die. We can’t all be admitted to municipal homes.

Quick reminder: 

1) Ford owes much of his political career to being mentored by family friend Mike Harris, Premier from 1995-2002. [Harris has made millions from the private LTC industry he created:](https://canadians.org/analysis/mike-harris-raking-profits-long-term-care-system-he-helped-create) 

&gt; ""Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) – including $4.29 million in 'deferred trust units' (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement)."" According to the article Chartwell's communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell's homes. ""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it's ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell's corporate boardroom while front line workers in homes are paid ""abysmal, poverty wages.""

2) Death rates in the private LTC facilities were quantifiably higher, because these for profit organizations almost always chose to return profits to shareholders - [instead of investing in creating safe workplaces and safe environments for the people they get paid to protect and care for:](https://healthydebate.ca/2020/12/topic/crisis-privatized-care-in-ontario/) 

&gt;Across Canada, 80 per cent of COVID-related fatalities have occurred in LTC facilities – double the average of other OECD countries.

Wages aren't reflected at all which has been an argument, but you're thinking the bottom 20% of the wage pool will drive up pricing on housing, when they still with a 25/h wage will barely be able to participate in the market because of the factors most researchers include in their papers.

&gt;Society should focus on making **secondary schooling free**, and child care free. So people can actually educate themselves better and get into a better paying field. Over being incentivized to continue working a lesser skilled job forever because they can’t afford to stop.

Canada is the most educated country in the world by population % with post secondary schooling ( University, College etc.) yet we have very low wages, So the argument that free education would raise everyone up is false, it does more damage to people without means and creates further class division.  The focus very much should be on ensuring that students by 18yrs old have been given the tools to enter the work force, and that post secondary education becomes tied to on job learning for the vast majority of non research based careers.   This school should be free concept has no barring in reality when comparing countries with cheap post secondary education and countries with expensive. 

We need to stop this concept of lesser skilled jobs, or that jobs without formal education don't matter,  Sorry but I rely on people who do the sanitation at the places I visit,  the value of their job is immense and those who have been doing it for 20+ years should be prideful that they can do it,  and they should earn a wage that is fair,  and they should be able to save 10-18% of their income every week towards a retirement in their 60's, and not live pay cheque to pay cheque or constantly looking for a career jump.  

$20-25 minimum wage will put wage pressure on jobs that do require degrees, and it also will put pressure on businesses who don't actually need degrees to consider if they are willing to pay the premium to get someone with it, our depressed wages have allowed job postings to pit people against eachother for lower and lower wages with more and more requirements,   

I've been making more than minimum wage for nearly 25yrs and my quality of life has improved every time minimum wage has gone up, not because my bank account has gotten better, but because those around me, those who I interact with daily are better taken care of.",hnclr9x,t3_r9b92a,1638727691,1638752891.0,/r/ontario/comments/r9b92a/if_you_raise_minimum_wage_to_20_n_hour_do_you/hnclr9x/,2021-12-05 18:08:11,2021-12

To be frank, I think the government is putting these restrictions &amp; rules out knowing full well it's not really enforceable. It's a way for them to please all perceptions of the pandemic &amp; they can avoid any major lawsuits. (The fines, for example, have pretty much been tossed - no one is paying them &amp; no one ever will; Even CERB fraud will go unpunished because Canada can't catch everyone who frauded it within the 7 year timeline - I mean they *could* if they trained &amp; HIRED people &amp; paid them a decent wage, but that won't happen because we can't even staff enough CRA reps.)

You're right, increasing wages won't solve the increasing case count, but I don't believe they truly care about the case count. Even picking up garbage (pay staff more) won't work - it's too late for that. I think they're letting it play out the way they want it to. WHY, I'm not 100% sure, but I do think the government is also very afraid to say: Hey, people are gonna die we really don't care too much because that's life. Even gen pop is terrified of death so that's the narrative (let's save lives!) they're *pushing,* but not acting on. I don't understand this part. I don't think we will anytime soon.

Hell, the most recent strike for CUPE a requirement that was to be voted on, brought in bad faith as well by the province, was that they *had* to give up the retirement package that's established and replace it with literally an unknown to be decided at a later date and be binding by this current vote.

[The Wealth of Immigrant Families in Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2019010-eng.htm)

Executive summary

The study uncovers several key patterns.

First, there is little evidence that the wealth of immigrant families during their first years in Canada has deteriorated since 1999 relative to a comparison group of Canadian-born families of similar age and education.

Second, most of the wealth growth observed from 1999 to 2016 for various groups of immigrant families came from increases in housing equity. In contrast, the growth in the wealth of Canadian-born families during that period was driven by increases in both housing equity and private pension assets. 

Third, synthetic cohort analyses suggest that the wealth of immigrant families tends to converge with that of Canadian-born families as time spent in Canada increases.

Fourth, while immigrant families’ rates of homeownership during their first few years in Canada were lower than those of comparable Canadian-born families, these rates converged during the subsequent 15 years. However, no convergence was observed for the incidence of registered pension plan (RPP) asset holdings.

Fifth, there is no evidence that immigrant families used payday loans to a greater extent than Canadian-born families of similar age

1. usually paid off their credit card balances each month to a lesser extent than their Canadian-born counterparts

2. had no credit cards as a result of refusals more often than Canadian-born families

3. withdrew money from registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) (for reasons other than buying a home, financing education or acquiring a registered retirement income fund [RRIF]) more often than Canadian-born families.

Sixth, the debt-to-income ratios of immigrant and Canadian-born families increased substantially from 1999 to 2016. In 2016, immigrant families had markedly higher debt-to-income ratios than their Canadian-born counterparts. However, debt-to-asset ratios grew moderately during that period. This suggests that a large portion of the increase in the debt-to-income ratios was driven by larger mortgages.

Finally, low-income rates among recent immigrant families dropped after the mid-2000s. As a result, the percentage of people living in families that were in low income and had no financial wealth also dropped among this group.",hml7qjh,t3_r52jsq,1638225555,1638250755.0,/r/ontario/comments/r52jsq/this_is_ridiculous_the_average_home_price_in/hml7qjh/,2021-11-29 22:39:15,2021-11

351,GuyMcTweedle,NovaScotia,"Yeah, these workers should definitely get more pay. It's important and hard work. But a few people feel strongly about the vaccines and are willing to lose their job over it. Maybe they would be less willing if it paid more, but I don't think money is the primary issue here other than perhaps weakening the system so it can't handle a small loss of employees like this mandate is causing.

I am not sure there will be many openings, at least right away. People with good jobs will be more likely to accept the vaccine, and even if they don't it will take a while before they are officially terminated. Many might even end up on unpaid leave and be allowed to return to work next year if the pandemic continues to fade. But during this time the public is going to have to put up with reduced services.

That said, I think this whole thing will push many into retirement or early retirement and that will eventually translate into more openings as people move up the org chart to fill these vacancies.

Second, I understand the need for consultants. The point was to show the increase in spending on consultations since 2015. To me that is indicative off waste. Consultation fees cannot have increased that much in that period of time. If hey have the taxpayers should have full breakdowns of what and why.
The other articles were to show that all the poor decisions and mismanagement of funds, adds up. And to show how difficult they make it to hold them accountable or even know where our taxes dollars are going. And those were from a single search page grabbed in less than 2 minutes.

it is increasingly apparent that we are in a new world where gta house prices don't drop, so helocs are essentially free money. in fact tons of people have bet their entire retirement on the ability to continually heloc. the gov can't shit can retirees like that right? that's why most plans aren't putting money into ltc, but rather to incentivise and have people self fund their last years, right?",hm3wi0m,t3_r209xi,1637893543,1637918743.0,/r/ontario/comments/r209xi/the_average_house_in_ontario_made_around_146228/hm3wi0m/,2021-11-26 02:25:43,2021-11
361,Armed_Accountant,ontario,"The key phrase in your first point is ""as good as it gets"". When hydro isn't available, it's the next best mass generation method. Hydro benefits from not needing its fuel processed and disposed of.

I'm in the industry (I'm guessing so are you based on username), so I'm aware of costs, and you can't look at true cost of our old plants through RPP. It does not account for the massive fixed costs that the province incurred before OPG came into existence. The debt transferring at that time was a massive kerfuffle on its own and we're still paying it down (via debt retirement charge up until 2018 when it fully transferred to general taxpayers). That charge is separate from RPP. But my point was supposed to be about new facilities being built, not our current. I'm rereading my comment and it appears I had a bit of a stroke, I'm not sure what my second paragraph was supposed to be about. In fact I agree with you. The reason our rates have remained relatively low (as far as Canada-wide is concerned, we're the highest among provinces with high renewable generation) is because our infrastructure is old and holding together quite well. New infrastructure is insanely expensive and that goes for new hydro and nuclear plants.

380,Wonderful-Thanks-959,alberta,"TFSA - any money grown inside it you can pull back out and don't need to pay tax on it, you are taxed on your income and then any money you put it can grow tax free.

&amp;#x200B;

RRSP you are taxed on your income, but any money added to an RRSP counts against your income line - the government accepts that you are saving for the future by reducing your useable income now, so they allow you to declare it and reduce what you are actually bringing home according to the CRA. This means your taxes you pay on each pay cheque were actually too much (because its based on you grossing 90k, when you put say 20k in an RRSP - Your actual takehome is only 70k, so you get a nice return based on overpaying taxes.

One way to improve your RRSP each year is to place your retirement savings in a TFSA (as long as you expect that it will continue growing). Near the end of the year you can sell all your investments in the TFSA - and move it into your RRSP. For example this year my TFSA account of the money I set aside has made $750. Now instead of having 3k go into my RRSP in the year, I'm putting in 3750, which means I get an even better return from my RRSP, and my tax return is larger than if I had just put it in an RRSP. On a good year it will actually increase your lifetime TFSA contribution limit, however on years you lose in your TFSA you will lose that contribution room.",hlt52xo,t3_qzqo2w,1637697717,1637722917.0,/r/alberta/comments/qzqo2w/home_ownership_expenses_estimated_and_reality/hlt52xo/,2021-11-23 20:01:57,2021-11

387,RubertVonRubens,ontario,"I'm so torn on the idea of property as an investment of any sort including a family like mine that owns a single home.

I own a home in Toronto. Its a small, 1930s semi in a neighborhood that was built to house blue collar workers. I bought in 2008 for 400k. It was listed as a starter home. The value today has increased by more than 150% (I did nothing to cause that increase in value other than not default on my mortgage).

I do have a line of credit against the equity that I am using right now to fund a renovation of that property which I expect to increase its value by another 70% by February. 

All of this is entirely reasonable and expected. I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing and I don't think I've run afoul of any housing activists.

I'm not a large property investor driving up prices but, what I'm doing still doesn't scale across generations. In 20 years I can extract a retirement out of this house either by liquidating it or by leveraging the equity (the house is not actually my retirement plan. If housing crashes I'll still be ok). But when I die, the next person who owns this house won't be able to do the same as me (unless this housing bubble keeps going forever and double digit millions is a reasonable 2040s starter home price). 

Housing is (or should be) an inalienable right. Shelter is #3 on the fundament needs list for humans. Housing cannot or should not be a wealth growth strategy -- by definition, in order to be a good investment something must appreciate faster than inflation. This necessarily means that for housing to be an investment it has to become unaffordable over time.

So how do we make this work? How can the cost of housing be sustainable? I really like the free million dollars I got and I think I am using it well to improve not only my home but my neighbourhood.

We're saying that nothing should entitle a business to somebody's labour for less than a living wage. If a job needs done, the people doing it should be paid enough to live a decent life. Contrary to what you may think, the people doing basic tasks like pushing shopping carts are performing necessary work; businesses wouldn't be hiring them if they didn't.

There's enough wealth in this province to go around. Basic shit like shelter, food, and having a family shouldn't be special privileges granted to those whose labour assholes don't look down upon. Sticking with your cart pushing example, Loblaws made $1.2 billion in profit last year. Surely they can find a way to continue operating without paying their lowliest workers like absolute shit.

If empathy alone isn't enough to make you understand why workers deserve living wages - and I fear it isn't - there's also the macro-economic situation to consider. Every worker who is not paid well enough to support themselves and their family, with enough surplus to save for retirement, may be making money for their employer, but they contribute relatively little to society in the way of taxes, and eventually become a burden on other tax payers in retirement (if not earlier). Why should ordinary people be called upon to share the burden of supporting people who spend their lives doing necessary work, but nevertheless are being chronically under-paid by massively profitable corporations to the point where they struggle to support themselves?

Besides, which is a healthier economy in the long run?

There wouldn't be losses on the pension if the government paid the payments they were legally supposed to pay. It would not have been a stock market loss if they did not stop making those payments.

Taxpayers are stakeholders in this. If the pension gets wiped out and the government stops payments, then all those workers will use more welfare and taxes will go up more than what the original payments would have been.

$70 million is not a lot for a pension that covers 1900 people. That is only 1 year of retirement. And it was not a realized loss. If they kept investing in it, it would be operating at a profit today. Now New Brunswick will have to pay more than if they didn't stop the payments.

411,visijared,NovaScotia,"As the article says, the wait list is growing twice as fast as it is declining month over month. Yes there is a high number of newcomers to the province - and more people suddenly care about having a family doctor in the first place due to health concerns - but in reality physician/NP retirements are driving this higher more than anything. Healthcare departures are at an all time high (and really, can you blame them?) either by retirement or resignation.

Not mentioned in the article is how a lot of doctors and nurses are not technically gone yet but on 'stress leave' and other temporary leaves, so they are still being counted in the labour pool but not contributing work hours. Many are right now busy using up their available leave time before they eventually quit or retire.

Also not mentioned is the dangerously low number of specialists available in the province. Crohns and Colitis patients, for example, are down to one (for all of Nova Scotia).

Soon we'll be seeing articles about medical tourism within Canada, ie. people with money travelling to Toronto from YHZ just to see a doctor about an ingrown toe. After those stories become increasingly more absurd, we'll eventually be hit with a full-scale, government-funded virtual medical system intended to more or less replace all routine in-person physician visits. Exasperated pandemic efforts or another large-scale medical crisis will only speed this up under the guise of protecting the precious few remaining medical professionals from viral transmission. Regular in-person checkups will become a thing of the past, unless you're well off enough that you can afford a private doctor on retainer.

In the old days, everyone had a family banker, a family lawyer, and a family doctor. Then everyone just had a family banker and a family doctor, and only the rich had family lawyers.

We'd have to find daycare for the kids.  We'd probably erase a significant portion of my retirement savings and have to pause contributions to the kids' RESPs.

But just because you have a family and commitments outside of work doesn’t mean the expectation stops. Teachers get “shoulder tapped” to coach all the time.

431,Thyanlia,ontario,"Not every family has willing/able grandparents to form a multigenerational household, nor does a North American attitude typically support such an arrangement.

Now, we could argue that it's idiotic that more families don't embrace a multigenerational household, but that's a long-held tenet that will be tough to break. We might see it happening more commonly in the future, as housing prices right now are discouraging to young folks who want to leave the nest, but the usual North American notion is that once you turn 18 you're off getting an education (and hopefully living on campus) or working to get the hell out of your parents' house.

Personally, we had our oldest kid 10 years ago. The year before we had her, we moved 2hrs away from any family who would be willing to help (because my husband was offered a job in his field). Those helpful family members, his parents, are established in their own careers and still have/had a long way to go before they would be ready for retirement. I struggle to see how living with them and foregoing my husband's well-suited job would have had any benefit to either his parents or to us.

434,peopleonaboat,newbrunswickcanada,"&gt; But, how do you act on a free market in a fair way?

I don't think there has ever been a free market for anything, but if such a thing exists it certainly isn't the housing market. Maybe in the Kowloon walled city, back when it used to exist. 

&gt; Also, as a home owner, I don't want to see my house value decrease. While I feel for people who want to buy their first house, why should I be punished?

This is the entire problem, the commodification of housing. If we accept the idea that housing should be a commodity to be traded, then everyone who already owns housing has a strong incentive to drive the price of housing as high as possible. This is why we get restrictive zoning, HOAs, the underfunding or outright neglect of public housing, and a mortgage system designed to ratchet the price of housing up as high as possible, etc. And it's simply not sustainable.

&gt; My personal opinion is that the best way to solve this is to offer ways to help first time home buyers (Either a one time tax deduction or tax free RRSP withdrawal or something similar), and also boost the economy. 

Unfortunately, people need somewhere to live to be productive members of society. People need to spend money on things in order to participate in the economy. There is no big red button labeled 'Economy Boost' that we can press to fix this problem without some pretty fundamental changes to how housing works.

&gt; If you increase wages for working New Brunswickers, they'll be able to compete against the influx of retired people from Ontario.

This has nothing to do with New Brunswick, or even just Canada. This is happening everywhere. Increasing wages for New Brunswickers is, of course, a really good goal. But without addressing the structural issues all it will do is inflate the price of housing even more. Either we do something to fix the problem (e.g. increase supply by massively investing in public housing), or else the economy gets strangled by the housing market and the prices drop anyway because no one can afford anything anymore. 

It's not like this is some unprecedented situation. If there isn't enough of something, you just have to build more of it. The only problem is that we've somehow decided as a society that fixing problems is impossible. We've determined that it's better to hope that the free market somehow decides to fix it for us, even when the incentives of every actor in that market are opposed to fixing the problem. Landowners, developers, contractors, lumber mills, landlords, bankers, real estate agents, etc. all have a vested interest in making sure that housing prices stay as high as possible.

&gt; Part of my retirement is based on my house gaining value.

That's great, but what happens if you have to move? What if interest rates go up dramatically, and you are forced to sell? What if the local government in your area becomes insolvent, and defers maintenance on your street for 30 years? As homeowners, we don't benefit from a system that forces us to cling to the value of our home like a life preserver.

436,zombienudist,ontario,"So you are 18-ish and plan to work the next 47 years until you are 65 making minimum wage.   Then you will start collecting whatever retirement benefits are available then.   I assume that no money was saved for retirement in this scenario.   It is almost impossible to know what will happen almost 50 years from now but now you will get less from CPP at max then you would from a minimum wage job.   So if that stayed exactly the same you likely would have to continue to work at least part time past 65 without any other retirement savings.   

Your goal seems to maximize your free time but in my mind this scenario means you will end up with less overall.   Sure you might get more on a consistent basis early on but over your whole life?

I mean you can get plenty of 9-5 jobs that pay better and that will require the same kind of actual daily effort as that minimum wage 9-5 job.  That will only require a bit of sacrifice now.     And what if you figure out that you can't live on 40 hours at minimum wage?  Once you are 10 years into that you don't have much option other then just working more hours as your skills you developed don't allow to charge more per hour so you just end up working more.   Plus jobs like that will have much less vacation time.   You get a decent union type job and after a few years will have decent vacations.    Not so much with a minimum wage job.  

I would carefully consider what you are doing here.   By not making a small amount of effort now your are going to cost yourself huge in the long run.   It is like saving for retirement.   Every dollar you save early on will return massively in the end because of the timeframe involved.  So even a small savings (or effort) can result in a massive gain in the end.   The same is true of yourself.  By investing in your skills now you will have a much easier time in the future.",hkurs61,t3_qushd7,1637071772,1637096972.0,/r/ontario/comments/qushd7/is_it_possible_to_live_relatively_comfortably_on/hkurs61/,2021-11-16 14:09:32,2021-11

442,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt; who would profit from sick people?

I can think of a few likely suspects. 

&gt;Harris has profited a lot from his part time boardroom-based job with Chartwell. According to the Toronto Star, he was paid $229,500 last year.

&gt;The Star also reports that ""Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) – including $4.29 million in 'deferred trust units' (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement)."" According to the article Chartwell's communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell's homes. 

&gt;&gt;""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it's ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell's corporate boardroom while front line workers in homes are paid ""abysmal, poverty wages.""

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors' homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

 Unless someone leaves me a house, I do not have a hope for home ownership. I will be paying some out of province speculator's mortgage until i die.

 I've already heard complaints about how NB needs to be more like another province. I've seen the beginnings of the strain that this is going to cause as retirees on fixed income are going to see skyrocketing property taxes. My parents have considered not having their yard plowed this year to put money aside for next year's anticipated tax bill. For a 70 year old couple with heart conditions and bad hips and knees, foregoing plowing isn't really feasible.

 My only hope is that the rise in cost of living forces wages to increase to compensate. The people in charge of thise province won't really be the people affected by these changes so until it hits their pocket books, fat chance of that. If they do change, all the benefits these migrants thought they would reap from a lower cost of living are just going to disappear. Especially for the retired people who bought as part of a way to make their retirement savings go further.

In some cases, landlords can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for approval to raise your rent (PDF) by more than the rent increase guideline.

  
In care homes (such as a retirement home), the rent increase guideline only applies to the rent portion of your bill but does not apply to the cost of services like nursing, food or cleaning.

Many Millennials would be in serious trouble if real-estate prices dropped suddenly by a non-trivial amount; an underwater mortgage eliminates nearly all flexibility (including selling the property).

Boomers who bought in 85 were wiped out by the recession shortly after which forced real-estate prices down; which other boomers holding cash with more reliable employment took advantage of (lots of heavily discounted cottages).",hkedhx4,t3_qsdzmq,1636762634,1636787834.0,/r/ontario/comments/qsdzmq/officials_are_now_closely_monitoring_the_rental/hkedhx4/,2021-11-13 00:17:14,2021-11

464,Insanious,ontario,"The hard part is trying to get money in without making the thing an investment.

If we remove all ROI on a home you incentivize renting over ownership. Regular people get screwed as well, as right now a lot of people put a lot of money into their home and it then can be sold as retirement savings as they get older. If there was no ROI on a home it would be common sense to just rent (why put money into something that will cost you more in the long run, you can have someone else maintain it, etc...) and we would end up with a lot more people running out of money in their old ages.

This would also still squeeze pooerer renters into an ever shrinking list of increasingly dilapidated homes as people who previously owned get into the rental market and just have more money to bid up rents over and above what people under them can afford to rent at. 

Changing what assets someone invests in doesn't at the same time change how our monetary system workers. It's still capitalism. It would still end up with rich people having nice homes and poor people having shitty or no homes.

The state could step in and start building houses for people. Then you likely end up with rich people also getting house built by the state. Either that or it would go to the lowest bidder and you would have a weird two tiered home system where private houses are nice, beautiful, energy efficient, etc... and public homes are built like crap and more than likely they would look like something built by the state and as such you could judge someone's economic standing or place in society simply on where they lived.

It creates other problems / issues than the ones we face now. It isn't a simple problem to fix. If we change one thing we aren't likely to end up in a significantly better one.

There is a world where we alter our incentives to own housing and suddenly only large REITS own houses and everyone rents. Rich people rent from the nice REITS that take care of them because they are shareholders. Poor people rent from REITS that don't give a shit since they aren't shareholders and who else are they going to rent from?

No more mom and pop landlords. No more small landlords. Only huge faceless corporations owning everything and everyone being treated like shit if they aren't rich enough. Probably even worse than now given at that point who else are you going to rent from? Bell, Rogers, or Tellus of the rental world?

That state isn't even that far away. Currently the ROI from owning vs renting is nearly equal. If you rent and invest the different between your rent and what it would cost to own that place every month you would statistically end up in the same financial situation as the person who bought their home and invested afterwards. 

The Uber rich already currently rent a lot of their property in this way in order to help with tax sheltering. It would just move down the economic rungs and start hitting the upper and middle class as well.

People need to be very very careful on what they ask for here because the world they are looking for (cheap, nice homes for everyone) is a difficult road to find, and then policies that could bring it into place are often un-intuitive and if put in part way could cause a significantly worse situation for everyone.",hkcyi9m,t3_qrvxjo,1636740221,1636765421.0,/r/ontario/comments/qrvxjo/fuck_doug_ford_and_all_his_scumbags_peers_all/hkcyi9m/,2021-11-12 18:03:41,2021-11

468,ValerieKlein,ontario,"Yeah, absolutely. Some are worse than others, but all of them are physical in nature. Plumbing and carpentry are some of the more difficult, usually. Welding is the most dangerous, I would say. Being blind sucks, and welders are often in the most dangerous areas of work. 

They all have a WIDE range of job types though. 

A cabinet maker who works in a small shop with air conditioning and rubber mat floors would probably be able to do that well until retirement without ever having any serious health issues. A carpenter who builds homes in the elements outside, would likely be exposed to the Sun for 8 to 12 hours a day, deal with different weather, and are working with large loads that may be dangerous. 

Welders could do the same thing, because there is a type of welding that involved doing so under water, and it poses a very high risk of implosion/explosions and electrocution.

470,rush22,ontario,"RRSP is for retirement. Whatever you put into your RRSP gets deducted from your year's income at tax time. Since your income is lower you owe less in taxes. And then since your income tax is automatically deducted from your paycheque (usually), you'll get a refund for the difference.

When you take that money out, you still have to pay the income tax on it -- but when you retire what you take out will be lower so you end up paying less.

This means that if you are making more then you expect to take out when you retire, you should put whatever you can into RRSPs. If you are _not_ currently making more then you will want to withdraw from it when you retire, then there's not much point. You can still use an RRSP for investing but locking it away in an RRSP is more for your own peace of mind.

The other thing you can use is a TFSA. This is more for short/medium term investing. The benefit of a TFSA is that you don't have to pay tax on it when it goes up like you do with just the stock market. You can take it out whenever you want and not pay any tax. However you only get so much per year you can put in -- you kind of ""waste"" it if you withdraw from it.

Banks will sell you their mutual funds. They won't sell you individual stocks or even other bank's mutual funds. These are a collection of a bunch of stocks geared towards certain categories, risk, etc. The way they make money on them is by charging a ""management fee"" for balancing them etc. They take this fee out of whatever you make. Most of the crappier and/or low risk mutual funds have low management fees. Most of the good and/or high risk ones have high management fees. So you have to balance that and also remember that even though their advice might be good they are still selling you something. If you have a ton of cash (like $100k+) then you'll get access to different funds. If you don't have a lot to invest you have a much smaller selection.

To open a ""real"" investment account with an actual bank and get access to individual stocks you also have to have an even bigger ton of cash. If you want to invest directly you can't use a bank and instead you have to use quest trade or whatever. They have RRSP and TFSA accounts too.",hk9ybgz,t3_qrz3nz,1636680005,1636705205.0,/r/ontario/comments/qrz3nz/guide_for_investing_in_canada_for_an_18_year_old/hk9ybgz/,2021-11-12 01:20:05,2021-11

Where did I say this? 

&gt;The average used car is 25k by todays standards.

&gt;New car does not mean rich, nor does owning your home mean you are wealthy. These are things that the middle class should and for the most part do afford. Many times at the expense of things like dining out, new clothes, vacations or retirement savings.

479,TraviAdpet,ontario,"So by your standards someone who buys a used 20k car every 4 years is wealthy? The average used car is 25k by todays standards.

The difference between buying a house 3 years ago and buy a house today is in the range of 200k-500k increase. A house that was 300k 1-2 hours drive from Toronto is now 500k to 700k. That’s takes a mortgage from being about $1400/month up to $2100 or $3000/month.

That’s anywhere from 1-3 new or 1.5-4 used monthly car payments increase.

New car does not mean rich, nor does owning your home mean you are wealthy. These are things that the middle class should and for the most part do afford. Many times at the expense of things like dining out, new clothes, vacations or retirement savings.

On the same note someone has to buy a new car, or used car prices are going to continue to sky rocket as there are less and less of them due age, theft or car accidents, that means someone will either buy an ICE or EV when they are both in the 40k range, the idea of a subsidy is to entire people to switch.

In the time frame of 2002-2006, every house was being sold to someone, for pretty outrageous prices, compared to 10 years earlier.  I bought a starter home in 2004.  It was actually maybe just a wee bit better than a typical starter home, but in that price range for the metro that I lived in.

All was well for us, until about late 2009.  I lost my job, and with a newborn at home and my wife on maternity leave from her job that paid about the same as mine.  I got back to work within about 60 days.  She went back to work a couple months later, then was laid off the very next week.  We both worked in banking/finance, and that industry got kicked in the balls in that time range.  Deservedly so, I guess.

So, we’re back working, paying the mortgage on time and everything.  She stayed home with the baby for a couple years.  We scraped by, but on time with the mortgage every month, without fail.  By this time, we’re in our mid 30’s.  We start to notice short sales and empty homes on our street.  We received a property tax assessment notice, and our value on the home was about 8% less than the year before. Talking about 2011 now.  It dropped a bit more in 2012, and again in 2013.  Still, we paid as agreed, and didn’t worry about being underwater on the mortgage, but a few other people around us were, with no end in sight.  Some walked away.  Some sold their homes and had to come to closing with a check, as the *seller*.  No personal checks, please and thank you.

By about 2014, we saw a home sell for about what we had bought ours for, and 3 others also sold for the same price, in 2003/2004/2005.  10 years after buying.  Of course, by now, we needed a roof, as the home was 17 years old, and the HVAC went out the same summer.  With minimal savings and no home equity that could be tapped, and our PMI we had paid for a decade finally off the note, those repairs had to wait.  We borrowed from our retirement accounts to have a new HVAC system installed, as this is in the American Deep South, and summer ain’t nuttin’ to f wit.

We sold that house just this past May.  Our gain on thr property, after 17 years of ownership, every monthly payment paid on time every time, was about 65% of what we paid.

Not every home in every town is going to climb into the stratosphere in value.  And things that go up, often, do come back down.  There are winners and losers with every economic cycle.  Lastly, don’t fret over what you don’t have, and others do.  This Gen X’r decided in the late 90’s that he didn’t trust politicians or policy at all.  I just work and take care of my, now, 2 daughters.  My wife works and does the same.  We vote with our dollars, now.  I gave up on ballots and voting booths and who’s conservative or who’s progressive, decades ago.  And, know what?  The rest of the world didn’t care.

Never said that. All I'm saying is **if** the only reason we aren't fixing these issues is because it will effect retirement and investment plans for one group of Canadians then that shouldn't stop us from fixing the country for the other group.

As of now a lot of people can't even afford to save for retirement or invest as their income gets eaten up immediately by inflated rent/food/services.

If you've been diligently saving for retirement that means you've been living a pretty privileged life compared to a lot of other Canadians that don't even have enough left over at the end of the month to put away for emergencies let alone retirement or investments.

Edit: The ""privileged life"" comment is subjective to the times. Yes you worked hard and were able to establish yourself but you did so in a time that rewarded you for that hard work and diligent savings. Today hard work and diligent savings is enough to make sure you aren't homeless on the street, it's not always enough to actually establish some equity these days.

509,magentachild,britishcolumbia,"Lots of houses for under 400k in Prince George. Even a few older smaller detached ones for under 300k

You can’t really compare prices from 30 years ago. Yes, they were a lot smaller, but interest rates were a lot higher. You were paying hardly anything to your principal. 

Even when I bought my first place for $97,000 at the super low interest rate of 4.5% in the mid-2000s, only about 10% of my mortgage payment was going against the principal for the first year. You basically double or more the price of the house just in interest. 

So the prices are high, but more of it is going into equity than to the banks even right at the start. People realize this and that’s why prices have gone up. If nothing else, a house is a place to park money that you can eventually get back when you retire. More practically, it’s an important nest egg that should be part of everyone’s retirement plan. 

Rent is easy and I’ve rented a lot. Had good landlords, locked in at low prices, was able to save a lot that I couldn’t have with a low equity mortgage.  But it was only for the end goal of home ownership while offering the flexibility of being able to easily pack up and move if I needed to. 

But with the way rents have been frozen and interest rates lowered and prices rising, most landlords are cashing out if they have long term tenants that won’t leave. The new landlords can then raise the price.. and some tenants are facing massive rent increases that absolutely dwarf the cost of home repairs. 

Lots of people I know who lived in southern BC have left BC forever. Some were forced out because of rents. Some cashed out to get rid of huge mortgages and catch up for retirement savings. 

Prince George is one of the few places in BC that’s left that has a decent balance of amenities, employment, and affordability. But probably not for long.

Canada hasn't been the USA when it comes to lending. Major banks do a LOT to ensure every mortgage is relatively secure. I worked as a mortgage specialist for a stint during this crisis and folks who can't afford homes are NOT getting homes. 

We increased the qualifying rate (stress test) recently and the folks qualifying for these mortgages are simply very well off. They either have significant savings and investments along with great jobs, OR they already own a home and have tons of built up equity. 

Even if interest rates rose an unheard of amount - people have already qualified to carry those mortgages at the increased amounts. That's the stress test people are passing up here. 

A collapse requires people to stop being able to afford their homes and I just don't see that happening. It will cool off and correct a bit but collapse? I just don't see it. 

Mix in the major issue that real estate has risen above all other options in this country as a viable investment option. Look at the options our parents and grandparents had - government bonds, defined benefit pensions, etc. none of that makes sense any longer. Stocks still make sense but putting 100% of your investments into the stock market isn't a sound plan. Real estate is the THE other option.

Several problems now exist: as the baby boomer age they are retiring earlier, living longer, and potentially collecting benefits for decades.  When DB pensions were introduced, age of retirement was 65 and most workers did not collect benefits for much more than 5 years.  Additionally, record low interest rates for 13 years has resulted in zero to negative growth of invested funds.  Corporations and governments would be expected to make up the shortfall, which is often billions of dollars.  Considering debt levels of provincial and federal governments that is a problem with no easy solution.

550,vereleye,newbrunswickcanada,"The Thursday offer was Higgs giving himself plausible deniability and distancing himself from the pension being the point holding things up. 

The wording requires the parties to ""negotiate"" a ""transition"" to a ""new retirement vehicle"" by a fixed date. June 30 2022. In the Friday press briefing he was stating that it was an independent process. I am not affected by the pension negotiations, from what I understand it is Higgs focus point because it will move from GNB being the main funder of pensions to equal funding from both sides which will clearly increase contributions from the members.

It seems Higgs is still trying to divide and conquer CUPE. One of his points at issue on Friday was that the unions being mandated back to work were not the ones affected by the pension changes. The Thursday offer also only included 7/10 of the striking locals. The counter offer was CUPE standing together and not selling out 5/10 of the striking locals by standing by the sticking point of 2 locals and including the three that Higgs excluded.

Lastly I had previously commented on his pensions for casuals points. 

""Starting from the beginning, past cost cuts have already narrowed the pool down to make every position as necessary as possible. This can be demonstrated by the abuse of the casual positions in which Higgs is propping up as as substantial part of his offer

Taken from the 1252 collective agreement article 2:

(d) ""Casual employee"" – A person who is not a “temporary employee” and who is employed on a temporary basis: (i) to respond to a temporary increase in workload, or (ii) to replace an absent employee. A casual employee shall have no guaranteed hours of employment.

In my local, after the last contract was signed (Nov 2017 four year contract expiring June 2019) casuals began being paid 100% of the base wage even though it was not reflected in the contract. In 2019 I also seen that casuals who have been working full time for a year or more could start paying into the pension. Temporary employees, for a temporary increase in workload is able to work full time hours for over a year, well before the pandemic and the [CEO of Horizon on Friday publicly stating that we are at sub optimal staffing 365 days](https://youtu.be/CBQYVFP66W0?t=1626) of the year should indicate that there is a need for permanent positions to be created.

Most voters are homeowners, so nothing will be done to lower home prices in the near future. To lower prices you would also need to build enough houses to match immigration rate, which is impossible.

The government’s public service sector has been downsizing for over 15 years now. Back then, the public outcry was that there were too many public servants, we were getting paid too well, our pensions were too good, etc etc, so the government at the time established a long term plan to downsize via attrition and retirement, eliminating positions as vacancies happen. We’ve been spread thin in all sectors of government for a good 10 years now, and it got extremely worse in the last 5. The healthcare and education sectors were also affected by this. We are now seeing the cause of this extreme downsizing. Tired and over worked public servants.

601,YEGMontonYEG,NovaScotia,"NS is amazing in 1000 different ways. Climate change seems to be working wonders in NS with the summer becoming better and longer. Early spring is entirely miserable with drizzle and grey endlessly blending one day with the next, but that is how it has been for as long as I can remember. The term ""Canada's Ocean Playground"" is right on the money. There is a reason the vast majority of the earth's population live on water of some sort, lakes, rivers, and primarily ocean. There is something soul soothing about having water nearby and due to the shape of NS there is Ocean a plenty as the coastline to surface area of NS ratio is fantastically high. 

The people of NS are generally nice. If you pull over anywhere rural and put the hood of your car up you won't be alone for 5 minutes before someone will pull over to help. If you have been to many places in the world this is not very common.

The economy is entirely in the shitter. People talk about the boom with all kinds of tall buildings going up. But when you look at how much fairly professional people get paid it is a complete joke. Any of the ""amazing"" growth industries are almost entirely propped up with tax-breaks and government grants. This latter, in my opinion, is actually destructive in the longer term.

When you boil down all government spending (not just the official budget) over 1/4 of the budget is from the federal government closing in on 1/3rd. Corporate income tax makes up about 2% of the budget. 

Taxes, fees, taxes, and more taxes, utilities, etc are all very high. This isn't just a whiny complaint but these numbers are well high enough to damage the economy. You can't competitively open a business in NS that uses any real quantity of energy. 

Even those few businesses that try to offer world competitive wages have trouble attracting talent as there are still two problems. Their spouses can't find commensurate work to what they previously had, and if you have a great job in NS it will be very hard to quit and find as good a one without leaving. Thus even supposedly great jobs in NS suffer from the cultural attitude of ""You're lucky to even have a job"" exuded by all employers in NS. In other places with real economies employers know that if they act like assholes people can leave in a heartbeat.

Then you have the litany of little problems. Nearly all world travel involves going to toronto. This really sucks when you want to go to NY or Boston and find the cheapest flights take you to toronto first. Occasionally, some airline will do a direct flight to desirable places like London or NY but they are booked hard and early or are offered by airlines that I don't trust.

Shipping to NS is more painful than it needs to be. In western Canada if you import something by mail it will typically clear customs in a few hours. In NS you see things go to montreal and get stuck in customs for days. This might seem only a minor annoyance, but if you are running a manufacturing business and are importing critical parts this could mean a few days of shutdown, or that you have to keep a larger reserve of expensive parts. In this world of JIT manufacturing it puts NS behind the curve. 

Internet and mobile aren't so great; spotty and expensive. This isn't the end of the world but again from a competitive point it doesn't help.

You can read reddit to see just how bad the medical system is. This is literally very dangerous. A cancer that would easily be caught in many other places might become deadly as it will take so very long to end up in front of a specialist if you don't have black goo leaking from your eyes or some other obvious symptom.

Did I mention taxes. This is endlessly grinding away at any hope of a real economy. That sales tax alone just gobbles up disposable income. It also covers things that other provinces don't hit which distorts the economy. Used cars are taxed. This has created a horrible situation where private used car sales are diminished meaning that you are pretty much forced to suffer the nightmare of dealing with used car dealerships. This is because if you are buying a car you use your trade in value to reduce the price of the car you are buying. For example, if you are buying a car for 50k and trade in your old car for 10k then you will only pay the sales tax 40k. This is a 1k savings in taxes. 

Salaries are typically lower in NS and when combined with higher income and other taxes it really makes a big difference. Then combine it with an uncompetitive grocery market an noncompetitive car market (look at who owns the various dealers in Halifax, just a few families) and a crazy housing market and you don't have a very attractive situation.

Other factors that grind away at the economy are even more subtle. The power company (monopoly for the most part) charges bonkers prices while not providing a reliable power supply. If you look at total hours down it doesn't seem that bad. But again, there are many industries where reliable power is something that is critical. Thus if you are expecting the very occasional blink from your local power company you can get away with a small battery backup. If you are looking at regular multiple hour shutdowns every bloody storm then you start looking at large battery banks combined with generators. It is this sort of thing that adds up and makes NS less competitive. 

I love NS whole lot. But quite simply the economy is such that it can't afford to attract me back. I can't move my business there for all the above reasons. I dare not move there for retirement some day as I don't want to die on my front driveway or from an easily preventable cause. None of these things can be fixed without fixing the fundamentals of the broken economy and the forces that prevent it from being fixed. 

If you want to see a single litmus test of where NS is entirely broken is look at Lyme disease. This is a pretty big problem greatly encumbering people enjoying the outdoors and attracting eco-tourists. Take a look at what the government is doing. Effectively nothing. If you ask the government what they are doing you will find they have hired some insiders ""to take a serious look at this issue"" and that they have many ""initiatives"" underway. The reality is that they are making no progress. This is everything from measurably doing anything to medical programs to aggressively help those infected. I know 3 people who have been infected and only one got rapid and easy treatment. The others had to run the slow gauntlet of the NS medical system. For example. They send tests of to central Canada instead of having a testing facility here. Those tests took something like 5 months to come back positive; which was about 4.9 months after treatment began.",hj5ao64,t3_qlg26g,1635946997,1635972197.0,/r/NovaScotia/comments/qlg26g/question_why_nova_scotia_specifically/hj5ao64/,2021-11-03 13:43:17,2021-11

NB is a dying province. Taxes and bloated regulations discourage small businesses from starting. The province has Stockholm Syndrome and has become too reliant on government to take care of it. Immigrants bail as soon as they're able.

I've always insisted ""if you want something done poorly, let government run it."" NB is a testament to that. Doctors don't want to stay. Competent tradesmen leave. I have watched a brain drain out of NB for 2 generations and what is left is... underwhelming. The term ""top stamps"" is practically unknown throughout the rest of Canada. 

NB has become a retirement province that doesn't want the noise or mess of allowing industries to develop. NB is a failed province that is propped up by more productive areas of Canada.

It has a beautiful waterfront which is a big factor in its growing status as a retirement community.

Cornwall also has a lot of companies servicing the heavy industry to be found along the St Lawrence. Surrounding Cornwall are many picturesque and pleasant villages throughout the counties that have the perfect balance of rural living (big well priced houses, peace and quiet) and modern amenities (such as FTTH). Outdoor pursuits and sports - golf, fishing, hiking, kayaking etc - are on your doorstep.

Budgets have 2 sides: expenses and revenue. You can cut back on spending but if you also cut back on taxes we are no better off financially, and often worse off.

Their political philosophy is always take away help from the people who need it to give more money to the people that don’t. Trickle down economics is not a thing. Conservative economics don’t work for the economy overall and leaves the vulnerable in a worse place

You have to invest money to make a return. Do you think your retirement fund will grow if you stop putting money into it? But it will be more money in your pocket now right?

The money spent on social programs has a return on the investment - it helps the economy grow which in turn generates more revenue. You can’t just stop at the expenses part of the equation.

Because in the government's point of view, they don't need to and you nor anyone is going to do anything about it.

It's pretty much the same with a lot of issues that needs urgency. Lots of elderly dying in retirement homes? Cool ok, they're going to do a teeny tiny improvement. Housing prices? Whatever, just release a new law that pretends it helps. Still can't afford anything with your minimum wage but essential job? Here's 10 cents.

I barely see any sustained, massive protest in Ontario (*or Canada*). If people want change, massive sustained protests is the fastest way to see results. Ones that are very big and lasts for a while that it also shuts down a city peacefully. Sadly, (*I remember reading this in a book*) peaceful protests don't work that well. The reality is that, objectively examining protests, violent protest has a faster and more lasting impact on political and policy change. Nonviolent protest brings awareness to an issue; violent protest brings urgency to an issue.

Sorry for going off on a tangent, obviously I don’t condone violence, and I’m not pushing for individuals to engage in unlawful behavior, but if we are objectively examining the influence of protests, we’re being disingenuous to say that violent protest does not bring individuals to the table, that it does not lead to policy change. That simply isn’t true.

So.... I guess all in all, there is really no incentive for the government to do anything. Near election, they can just quickly bring a new law to show how caring they are, then quickly abolish it by introducing a countermeasure law and not fulfil any of their promises.

Idk what GTA you’re living in, but even with some absolutely ridiculous estimates, like $12000 on fun and misc expenses and $7400 of random money spending, as well as finance rates and insurance on a new car instead of something used (and only morons buy new cars), you have $15k left over.

I’m all for raising the fuck out of the minimum wage, but pretending like an actual good wage of $50 an hour is nearing poverty or struggle levels is incredibly demeaning and disrespectful to the vast majority of people who would be wildly happy with the life of $100k yearly in the GTA.",hize87o,t3_qkpja0,1635834642,1635859842.0,/r/ontario/comments/qkpja0/why_the_fuck_havent_we_moved_up_the_minimum_wage/hize87o/,2021-11-02 06:30:42,2021-11

627,darksoldierk,ontario,"A house has never been something that every canadian has the opportunity to own. Furthermore, there have ALWAYS been cycles, that's how housing works, that's how most markets work. The problem isn't either of those things. When your friend bought 7 years ago, it makes sense that he paid less than you, he took on a risk when you weren't willing to. Assuming you and he had the same amount of money saved and your attitudes towards risk are similar, he took on more risk because, logically speaking, you had 7 additional years to save more money and, for all you knew 7 years ago, the markets may have stagnated or decreased. I don't think anyone thinks they should be able to own a house just because they breath. Home ownership has always been an option for some, but not all. 

The problem isn't that home ownership could only be available to some, the problem is that houses have been artificially propped up. The government has done things in order to ensure that the housing market doesn't crash because it knows that older people are relying on their homes to retire, and if housing crashes, the government will have a significant amount of older people who don't have money. It's the government making the young pay, indirectly, for the retirement of the old. THAT is the issue. The issue is that interest rates needed to increase 6 years ago. Steps should have been taken to reduce homes being purchased as investments to historic norms. During covid, the government shouldn't have given money to people who own homes and investment properties. The government didn't protect my stocks from crashing in march of 2020, they didn't give me any free money when my stocks were going in the shitter, so why did they protect individuals with investment properties. If you couldn't have made the mortgage payment on your investment property, you shouldn't have been able to defer your mortgage payment on your principal residence, you should have been forced to sell your other properties to raise the funds to pay for your investments. 

At least to me, that's the problem. I don't mind working hard, I don't mind saving, but I mind when I've spent 10 years of my life living like I'm in college, saving over 200k to still be forced to choose between renting and taking on a mortgage that's over worth over half a million dollars. I have a problem with that. I have more problems with the fact that the only people who can afford to buy are the real estate agents, who make money by taking advantage of people, and people who bought decades ago and use the equity of their current homes to buy investment properties, inflating the prices even higher.

633,Iceededpeeple,ontario,"&gt;Bullshit. That’s how it was for the Boomers for decades. Good factory job. Couple of kids. House. Cottage. Boat. Multiple cars. Retired with pension.  

Well, perhaps for some Boomers they had good factory jobs, my dad worked in a steel mill and made more than most working in production. We had a 14 foot fiberglass flat bottom boat from the late 50's with a 40 horse motor.  It was a complete piece of shit, but we certainly used it.  We had a house that was paid off by my 15th birthday, but it was no palace.  A place that was only livable because my father literally renovated the whole place. He did that with the 3 houses we lived in when I grew up.  We could never afford a cottage.  By the 80's we started getting a new vehicle every 4 years or so.  Our only second vehicle when I was a kid, was a used Ford Pinto.  Which my father and brother (who was in highschool) changed the engine and transmission in because the old one screwed up.    Oh, and yes he retired in 1995 with an okay pension, that went for a complete shit in 2000 when the company he retired from (which was doing well) was bought by another company that 9 months later declared bankruptcy and immediately cut his pension almost in half.  Oh, and in my late teens my parents bought a variety store, renovated that building/house, increased business 4 fold and sold it for a profit of about $60k in 1988, which was about 40% more than what they paid for it.  But they both had 100 hour work weeks for the time they owned it.  Oh, and my mother always worked when I was a kid, and we still couldn't afford what you espouse, and my parents aren't even Boomers, they are from the Silent Generation.  My sister is a boomer, who's business is finally paying off enough that she can move out of my basement.  

Yes you are correct the job situation has been gone for a very long time in Ontario, it's not something new.  I worked for a major contract pharmaceutical manufacturer, (15 plants in 7 countries) for a decade and a half.  They sold my facility to another company and the new company went out of business a decade ago.  We had decent pay and benefits, and unemployed by 40.   Housing, yep that one is a complete shit show.  I worked hard in order to buy my first house 20 years ago, when things were moderately more affordable.  I'm now stuck in my current home until retirement, which could allow me to move to somewhere like Manitoba or Newfoundland in search of a cheaper home.  I don't live in the GTA, so my home isn't worth $1-2 million, more like $500,000, which limits my options, rather severely.  I have a brother and SIL who are now retired military living in Ottawa.  They want to move down to the Niagara region (where I live) in the spring.  My brother had the idea that he would be able to sell his home in Ottawa for $1 mil and buy something equivalent here for half of that.  He's had a real eye opening that to get the equivalent property he has in Ottawa, it will likely cost him close to $1 mil here.  

So do tell, what was your experience with your boomer parents?  Why don't you just get them to lend you the $500k they obviously have sitting around so you can buy a house?  Or are your parents not Boomers, or that rich?  I mean you suggest they must be.

638,EvangelineOfSky,newbrunswickcanada,"The problem comes down in a big part to the fact, we are sort of the Florida of Canada.

By that I mean, we are a retirement province. For generations we have encouraged kids that don't desire to go into the trades to leave the province as \*the only future in NB is in the trades\*, they do, and they only come back when they are retired for the lower living costs to live off their pension.

Ontop of that, we are sort of the \*Bible Belt of Canada\*, probably more of the \*if its not in the bible, its wrong\* types in new brunswick than most other provinces.

Combine that with our education rates, we don't have a lot of young people in the province to actually push for change, but a lot of older people and/or strong religious conservatives who are scared by it.

Oh I also won't deny, there is potential in this province, the bigger problem is the population stifles it. The poor and middle class are resistant to change, so most of the successful small businesses in the province (With the exception of trades) have been a family thing inherited through family lines, and people aren't normally open to even checking out a new competitor because \*This is where you go for that, its the way its always been\*. At bigger business, the province has historically passed legislation to prevent any big businesses to enter the province that could theoretically \*step on Irvings turf\*.

There was a post from a guy that moved here as a business consultant like a year ago but I am having a hard time finding it, so I will tell you my own personal experience.

I worked for an MSP in the province for quite a few years, left that job January of 2020 due to a mental breakdown and have been out of work for health reasons I can't really get treated in this provinces health system.

In that time I handled and managed the IT infrastructure for several businesses in the Province, Retail, Construction, Law, Private Medical Practices, materials, even a pet food company.

Part of my Job as an MSP involved of course auditing my clients, and telling them what isn't up to standard. In many cases, and the rest of the employees there were all victims of this same mentality, we'd go \*okay, this will cost you $500, but it will save you $120 a year, and make sure you are secure from cyberattacks or losing all your company data because you are using your Secretaries 10 year old PC as your company server\*.

We could explain the risks, how it would make things more convenient, how it will save them money, or how it could prevent them being unable to actually operate without months of downtime and tens of thousands of dollars in white room data recovery.

The response would normally be \*Well we haven't had any problems before now, your just trying to trick us!\*.

they would ignore everything we said, then when our predictions were right and half their employees cant come to work,  unwilling to take responsibility for it they will just badmouth your firm to everyone they know, which definitely isn't great in a province that operates on such a small town mentality.

There is potential in this province, but when the general populace is so scared of change and anything that is \*different from what they have always known\*, actually achieving that potential is near impossible, especially with Irving owning businesses in nearly every sector and the government very much doing things to try and favour the irving businesses over any competitors.",hiuvq6x,t3_qjt8k2,1635748590,1635773790.0,/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/qjt8k2/new_brunswick_government_locks_out_cupe_union/hiuvq6x/,2021-11-01 06:36:30,2021-11

Media typically report using language that characterizes unions and their members in a negative light.  We all know why media outlets do that in general: if it bleeds, it leads.  It's an age-old media-selling trick we nowadays call ""click bait.""

You can draw any number of conclusions as to why more specifically it's the unions rather than the employers that are vilified by the media.  Some union members dropping nails to stop traffic is a commonly-relatable idea, whereas an employer making an offer that includes rolling back retirement allowances seems vague, distance, and unrelatable to most readers.

There's also the matter of media outlet saying something libelous against a business larger than themselves.  Conversely, reporting something negative a few union members do can easily paint the whole union in a negative light, and those individuals or even their entire union doesn't have the resources to defend against erroneous or misleading characterizations along those lines.

658,ShaRose,newfoundland,"I'm aware of the rest of the symbolism, but the vast majority of that doesn't apply in the situation you were trying to compare it to, so I ignored the more fantastic / personal parts.


I agree that it's the feeling of nostalgia and sense of home, or rather a sense of belonging that keeps people there. Carl basically outright says he planned on dying there, and they could do whatever they wanted after that. I loathe to try and empathise with a billion dollar company, but Carl hanging around in the limelight there could be easily costing them millions of dollars a year. That skyscaper could be providing real estate that would free up considerable medium to high density housing. That's not even considering if it might be a housing complex or set of condominiums itself: he alone could be delaying available housing for dozens of families just to hold on to his nostalgia and continue living when he doesn't really enjoy his life. He might have actually *enjoyed* his time, while still missing his house, in a retirement home. Hell, considering how easily the house split off, he could have asked if they could move the house to another plot of land: the money they were burning to make offers might have legitimately made it worth it.


It is a kids movie, but in reality holding on like that in old age usually just ends up hurting yourself. I know people who refused to go to old age homes, were on waiting lists for high quality ones and turned it down: then had some kind of medical problem that removed the choice of where they'd go.

Contractors get less time off, no retirement benefits, no union protection or HR representation, and must take unpaid leave or vacation if the place of work has a snow day or a “staff day off”. When public servants are allowed to go home early, contractors are not allowed. Also contractors don’t have leadership roles, so there is no upward mobility, unless it is to resign and find a promotion elsewhere.

670,PrestigiousNewf,newfoundland,"I'll be the first to discredit the idea of ""let's resettle everything past the Isthmus"". 

But look at St. Brendans. A population of 145 in 2016, and a ferry service that costs [6 million dollars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ferry-service-costly-1.4364449).

That's an annual cost of almost $42,000 per resident. It'll be interesting to see the next census, and I'm willing to bet the community is shrinking. 

I'm sure St. Brendan's is a wonderful, peaceful place to live. But if I'm starting a family, I want my kids to have access to health care, education, and the amenities of a larger populated area. If I still want them to have a connection with the outdoors, hunting, fishing, etc. There are plenty of amazing spots across the island to do that. Anything less is selfish in my books, and by staying in a dying community, serviced only by ferry, is doing them a disservice.

On the other spectrum of that, if you're elderly, or nearing retirement and you own your home out in St. Brendan's, your kids are all grown up with families of their own living elsewhere. Someone offers you $250,000 for your home. Why wouldn't you take it? When you reach your late 70s and 80s, you will inevitably need more access to healthcare and facilitated care. You will need to leave your home. Why not see the writing on the walls and take the deal? Even if you wanted to keep your independence at that age, $250,000 will buy you a house in certain areas of the island.

I know things aren't always measured in monetary value. And if you want to be frank, Fuck the taxpayers who subsidize the cost of my $42,000 a year ferry service. But a deal like that benefits you more than it would benefit anyone else.",hidrvbg,t3_qgzrw3,1635430038,1635455238.0,/r/newfoundland/comments/qgzrw3/government_updates_community_relocation_policy/hidrvbg/,2021-10-28 14:07:18,2021-10

I'm also unsure of what is happening is the ER and there are still other departments that only have enough people to cover each other so if one is gone then hours are cut in half. At the LTC home I work at we are going to loose a detrimental amount of psw's and support staff. 

I know it is easy for people to scoff and just say screw those people who don't want to get the vaccine but there is no plan for us more rural regions besides closing beds and using ambulances to transport people to the other overly filled hospitals... 

No one seems to get that at this time loosing even one nurse is a big deal. There isn't an abundance of us to pull from and less coming into the field. We were already about to deal with a retirement crisis. My ona conference call tonight showed how many nurses are planning on leaving the profession in the next 5 years and it is devastating.

 * Cut funding to education and reopened the door to school and transportation fees (can cost parents up to $800 per child per year depending on school and where you live)

 * tore up the funding agreement with municipalities forcing cities and towns all around Alberta to jack up property taxes to make up the shortfall

 * forgave property taxes for many O&amp;G companies, further exacerbating the shortfall for many rural communities.

Second you will note that for a number of years you have not seen the debt retirement charge on your power bill any longer because we have payed off our nuclear assets.  Furthermore we can see exactly what nuclear costs the rate payer in Ontario by looking at the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) reports.  The OEB is the Provicial Government regulator that sets prices for consumers in Ontario.  If you look at that data you will find that  not only is nuclear the second cheapest (beat only by hydro) it also recieves an undersized share of the global adjustment charges meaning it is keeping your bill lower than it otherwise would be (see page 17):

I'm confused by you saying this - do you think that their actions were somehow counter to how society thought about it? Do you believe the Catholic Church was coerced into running those places?  I wonder what utopia you're envisioning if those didn't exist.  It was truly horrible, but I'm sure that the horror would have been expressed in other ways if not that one.  In America they opted for straight genocide instead.


&gt; I would prefer that people die from government negligence then government interference. 

That's an amazing statement.  That's saying you'd prefer that government retirement homes didn't exist and those people left to fend on their own rather than trying to help them.  Hospitals should be abolished because it's better that no patient dies of negligence due to budget cuts.  Instead of demanding a higher standard, you say there should be no standard. Wow.

Like all Acadiens, she longs to return. I built a nice business out here and just finalized the sale of it. As a gift, I bought her a home by the sea in her hometown of Beresford.

721,PM_ME__RECIPES,ontario,"&gt;I've visited a lot of private (very expensive) ones and public ones.

Hi, if you're in Ontario then the ""private (very expensive"") home you visited was *not* a licensed LTC home. It was likely a retirement residence, senior living community or assisted living facility. These types of facilities are significantly less regulated &amp; receive little-to-no government funding in general. Some may offer LTC-like additional services at additional cost, but they are not Long Term Care Homes. If I recall correctly there's maybe 1 or 2 actual unlicensed (&amp; thus not subject to the LTC Homes Act of 2007's regulations, but also receive no funding) for-profit LTC homes in the province - you'd be looking at monthly rates in the $15,000+ range, probably closer to $20,000.

In Ontario, all LTC homes are provided equal funding per resident from the province and are required to charge the exact same per diem fees to the residents (depending on bed class &amp; whether the bed is built &amp; listed as a basic, semi-private, or private bed) regardless of whether they are a municipal home, a non-profit, or a for-profit entity.

Currently a basic LTC bed has a monthly charge of $1,927. A New-Class or A-Class semi-private bed has a monthly charge of $2,323.23. A New-Class or A-Class private bed has a monthly charge of $2,753.02. And again, these charges are the same regardless of whether the facility operates under a municipality, as a non-profit entity, or as a for-profit entity.

If you were quoted a monthly cost which is *not* any of the above numbers, then congratulations - it wasn't a licensed LTC home at all.",hh9j143,t3_qb92vy,1634668587,1634693787.0,/r/ontario/comments/qb92vy/pcs_defeat_ndp_motion_to_stop_licensing_private/hh9j143/,2021-10-19 18:36:27,2021-10

725,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt; money is more important that the humane treatment of people in need

Mike Harris is a longtime friend of the Ford family, and connections with guys like him are how Doug Jr failed upward to premier. Interestingly: 

&gt;Harris has profited a lot from his part time boardroom-based job with Chartwell. According to the Toronto Star, he was paid $229,500 last year.

&gt;The Star also reports that ""Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) – including $4.29 million in 'deferred trust units' (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement)."" According to the article Chartwell's communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell's homes. ""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it's ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell's corporate boardroom while front line workers in homes are paid ""abysmal, poverty wages.""

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors' homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19

746,LemmingPractice,alberta,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What the hell does the amount the population of Alberta pays in federal taxes have to do with our deficit?

You seem to be misunderstanding the comment. The ""deficit"" I was talking about was the deficit between the amount of money we send to Ottawa and the amount we get back. That's what the $17.46B represented in 2018 (how much more money was sent to Ottawa in federal taxes than what the feds spent in Alberta on expenditures). 

So, basically, the thrust of the calculation is that Alberta sent $17.46B more to Ottawa in 2018 it got back in expenditures, and only $2.28B of that money went into the equalization, thus substantiating my previous comment that equalization was only a small portion of the discrepancy.

&gt;No, but it's got nothing to do with how many federal employees work in the province.

The number of federal employees in a province is a direct reflection of how much money the feds are putting into a province. It is also another way that the feds help out certain provinces, since those federal employees pay provincial income taxes and spend the federal cash used to pay their salaries in the local economy in which they work and live.

&gt;This is the silly argument. If the whole equalization program went away today, we'd still be paying the same federal taxes tomorrow.

Potentially, but if that happened the government would have $18B more a year to spend on something that might actually provide some benefit to provinces other than Quebec and the Maritimes. 

&gt;If your argument is too much money leaving the province then we're talking about provincial taxes, not equalization.

Huh? Why are provincial taxes leaving the province?

&gt;Look up how much federal taxes are as a percentage of the GDP of other provinces, do they pay nothing?

Again, you are totally ignoring the point I was making. That number isn't the percentage of GDP we pay in taxes. That is the percentage of GDP that represents the **difference** between what we pay in taxes and what Alberta gets back from federal expenditures. As a percentage of GDP, the second highest discrepancy in the country is BC who send a net of 3.3% of their GDP to Ottawa (ie. more than what they get back in expenditures). That's about half of what Ottawa has been taking out of Alberta every single year for decades.

You also seem to be entirely ignoring the other part of the equation: Alberta receives by far the least expenditures of any Canadian province. That's not ""everyone has the same tax rate"", that's where the government chooses to spend the money we send them.

&gt;So we're agreed that lowering taxes in a recession or depressed market (when there are fewer new market opportunities) is a bad move then.

No, it's actually the approach you should be taking. Lowering taxes is a good way to help stimulate an economy and help it recover.

The part Kenney did wrong wasn't lowering the taxes, it was the austerity budget that went along with it. You want to deficit spend in bad times to get things moving, and save during good times so you have the capacity to spend on the next rainy day.

A lot of economists consider the reason the Great Depression lasted so long to have been the approach of governments in raising taxes on an economy that couldn't sustain the higher rates, exacerbating the problem. Which is why modern economies all took the opposite approach during the financial crisis and COVID with massive stimulus spending to get the economy moving.

&gt;Yes, they absolutely do because the stock buybacks give them an immediate benefit that expansion doesn't, as does debt pay-down, and they're less risky. That's leaving aside the obvious if they even want to expand and if the market conditions are right. Companies don't expand unless they see significant long-term benefits to doing so, and in a depressed economy the safest thing to do is consolidate your finances until things look up.

You don't do a lot of investing do you? Investing is all about growth. It's why tech companies who lose money year after year get multi-billion dollar valuations as long as revenue growth is strong. Investors want to see growth, and will often complain when companies aren't taking on enough debt to achieve growth.

Stock buybacks are essentially a final ditch option to show that companies are putting money to use, and they only do it when they have more money stashed than they can use to spend on growth.

I don't think there is a single company on the stock market that is not interested in growth. The whole point of being publicly listed is to raise capital for growth. Companies are publicly listed so they can use their stocks as currency to raise capital, or to make acquisitions. Without that there's no point in going through all the regulatory compliance requirements of being publicly listed in the first place.

&gt;It goes into the company offshore tax havens and the pockets of execs and shareholders who, being high earners, will also invest it or move it offshore. Very little goes back into the economy in the way you believe.

That's just a pile of left wing talking points. Do you know how offshore tax havens work? A very small percentage of money ends up going to tax havens, and the money that does is after tax money (since those publicly listed companies paying execs bonuses report all that money to the CRA and withhold taxes on it). 

And, execs can't just go sending all their money overseas if they still live in Alberta. They pay their mortgage, buy groceries, buy bigger houses or cars, or whatever else.

Also, you know that large portions of these companies are owned by pension funds, retirement savings funds, and other groups that invest money for normal people saving for retirement, right?

As for the way you just brush off high earners ""investing"" money, that's a good thing. How do you think business get started? They get started by people investing money into them. That's what the economy wants. Local capital is a necessary precondition to any successful entrepreneurial ecosphere.

&gt;That paper found that tax cuts over the last 50 years only really benefited the individuals who were directly affected, and did little to promote jobs or growth.

There are numerous economics papers that say the exact opposite. The one with the newspaper style headline that pretty clearly starts with its conclusion and works backwards isn't the one that's going to convince me.

&gt;As I've already said, and as the last few years in Alberta have shown, giving companies tax cuts does not result in expansion and more jobs. Take a look at the GoA economic dashboard and you'll see that.

I mentioned this in my response to your other comment, but it bears repeating: **there was a freaking pandemic with lockdowns that started before the first tax period after the changes were made**. Alberta has 40+ years of solid evidence on the benefits of low taxation. A couple of years in a pandemic don't change that, and it requires some pretty heavy bias to take the lack of immediate results for tax cuts in the middle of a pandemic to mean anything.

&gt;Manufacturing (you know, that other industry I mentioned that's not O&amp;G) gave us $704m in taxes in 2019, O&amp;G $119m, Museums &amp; Art Galleries $157m.

Again, corporate taxes are a very small percentage of the overall picture. O&amp;G also paid $5.4B in royalty revenue to the government in 2019, which aren't included in your numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Those numbers also don't calculate in any income taxes from the industry that is by far the largest employer in the province. And, you took numbers from a year in which the province was under mandatory production caps due to the pipeline crisis.

Your numbers are a very long way from representing the overall impact any of those industries has on provincial coffers. Corporate tax revenues are an awful way to calculate that, especially since the ideal situation would see no corporate tax revenues because those companies would be re-investing that money into growth (thus creating more jobs and more income tax revenue) instead of taking profits.

&gt;You want to stick with it despite clear evidence that it isn't working now?

Feel free to show me any evidence that is remotely convincing and I will happily consider it. Showing me that a 4% corporate tax rate can't outweigh the impact of a once in a century pandemic ain't it.",hgsn2p4,t3_q82uqu,1634337367,1634362567.0,/r/alberta/comments/q82uqu/albertans_got_more_federal_covid_support_per/hgsn2p4/,2021-10-15 22:36:07,2021-10

751,lightoasis1,ontario,"The short answer is because there is much more to getting top dollar for your home than favourable selling conditions. 

Capping a fee regardless of sale price presents issues to homeowners especially those with larger, higher priced homes and a smaller pool of buyers to attract.

You'd also be completely changing the brokerage model as profit margins in the industry would be completely changed overnight. You'd lose the vast majority of agents (not a bad thing) but the remaining agents would only survive under the umbrella of a large brokerage or ones that have developed a large, well-known team. 

Clients would likely have to pay out of pocket for expenses related to listing the home as well. Home prep, photography, staging etc would be expenses that brokerages could no longer afford to offer as part of their service (again, assuming a flat fee regardless of list price). 

There's also the human behaviour aspect of things. Take for example a discount brokerage like PurpleBricks. The listing agent is paid a salary. They're not incentivized to sell the home for more money. It becomes a volume shop. Get the homes sold, adequate customer service and nothing more. Some sellers would be leaving money on the table in a system like this.

Not that that is necessarily a bad thing for society, but let's be honest - people don't want to do that when this is their largest asset/retirement fund or a way to help secure a future home for their children.

The answer to the housing crisis isn't easy and I agree a revamped commission structure would have its place in helping to fix it, but I doubt a flat fee regardless of price is the one. 

Perhaps a modified system like they have out west where it's like 7% on the first $100,000 and 2.5% on the rest is a better system to look towards. On an $800K house, that's $15K less in commissions paid to agents.

758,Brendone33,alberta,"I’m not sure how it works in larger cities with full time fire departments but I know AHS contracts out to many small rural fire departments for something called the Medical First Responder (MFR) program. This is where a fire department is located much closer than an ambulance service, so 911 sends trained MFRs (who know basic first aid, cpr, basic life support and carry an AED, oxygen and Naloxone) to respond to high priority calls (suspected heart attack, stroke, allergic reaction, acute respiratory distress, drug overdose etc) to aid the patient until an ambulance arrives. 

Most of these firefighters are trained professionals but on a paid on call capacity (meaning they are unpaid for training, and are on call all the time, and are paid a small amount such as $20/hour when they respond to calls). There are hundreds if not thousands of these people providing first responders medical care in rural areas of Alberta. 

AHS pays the department and the fire department pays the individuals who respond to the call. 

AHS requires MFRs to be vaccinated for Chicken Pox (Varicella), Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Polio, Tetanus, Diptheria, Whooping Cough (Pertussis), seasonal Influenza and have added effective as of October 31, must be fully immunized against Covid-19. 

Many calls are to elderly people and into retirement homes. Where I live the closest ambulance typically takes 20-40 minutes to arrive (we have a retirement home in town, and also a large rural area we service) while the Fire Department often responds in under 10 minutes. 

Our Fire Department has not made it mandatory to be vaccinated (yet?) but our Chief has made it clear that if you aren’t, you can no longer respond to MFR calls. If the department can’t field enough MFRs to keep up with calls, or don’t want to, they can withdraw from the program (but obviously rural departments will want that sweet AHS funding). 

I don’t know why some firefighters (as a subset of the rest of rural Alberta I suppose) are resistant to getting this vaccine but had no problem with the list when they got onto their department but I definitely know in my town, there are some.",hgowz1i,t3_q8cuko,1634265687,1634290887.0,/r/alberta/comments/q8cuko/group_of_alberta_firefighters_challenge_ahs/hgowz1i/,2021-10-15 02:41:27,2021-10

""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

765,Oderdigg,alberta,"Naheed Nenshi is the 36th Mayor of Calgary. He is leaving office on Oct. 25.  
  
Typically, politicians at the end of their terms look backward, on their legacies. Certainly, the top question I have been asked since announcing I would not be seeking re-election is, “What are you most proud of?”  
  
It would be a lie to say that I have not been spending a lot of time thinking on what we’ve accomplished as a city, but I also find myself looking at where we find ourselves now, and looking forward. Thinking about what we have not achieved, I’m forced to examine how the promise of this great country has not been kept, and how much work we have left to do.  
  
We are at a crossroads in our country. We have five future-defining crises in front of us, any one of which could bring a lesser society to its knees: a public-health crisis in the pandemic, a mental health and addictions crisis, an economic dislocation like none we’ve seen before, an environmental crisis, and a reckoning on the issue of equity. This is all playing out at political and national levels, but also in every one of our families.  
  
It all feels sometimes like too much. Is our country ungovernable? Are the voices of anger and hatred and division simply too loud? Have they won?  
  
I don’t believe that. I never have. I can’t. I won’t.  
  
The promise of this nation is a promise to humanity – a promise we cannot afford to give up on.  
  
Alberta is holding a referendum on equalization – and you’ll never guess what isn’t going to happen next  
  
In Canada, the rule of law is giving way to the rule of will  
  
The promise of a place where everyone belongs. Where we offer a life of dignity and opportunity to all, a beacon of light and hope in an often cold, dark and cruel world.  
  
For that promise to be kept we have to light that beacon, and we have to safeguard and nourish that flame.  
  
In one way, the pandemic has been helpful (the only good thing about the pandemic) in that it has upended all of our expectations about how society works. Now it’s up to us to form something new. We are in a wet clay moment; we must mould the future now, before it sets.  
  
We have solutions before us on how to get out of the pandemic, on how to build our economy into something new, with decent jobs for all and on how to manage the climate emergency. We even have a roadmap (partly through Calgary’s community action plan) on mental health and addictions. We just have to be brave enough to make the tough choices, take the hard road. But that fifth issue – equity – is the cornerstone, the foundation of all the rest.  
  
These past 18 months woke so many of us up, in so many ways.  
  
We realized that the most poorly paid people in our society are actually the ones we rely upon the most: long-term care workers, retail clerks, delivery drivers.  
  
We learned that regional disparities in our country persist, and that the West is truly taken for granted.  
  
And we learned, too many of us for the first time, that we have not created a society where Black lives and Indigenous lives truly matter.  
  
So how do we build a more just, a more equitable society? What will it take? We need courage. We need to listen and understand each other. We need to get beyond partisanship and easy answers to make those decisions.  
  
Most of all, we need all of us – everyday people, with our everyday hands and our everyday voices – to lead.  
  
We are at a pivotal time. Certainly, we need politicians – municipal, provincial and federal – to step up. But we as citizens need to also meet the moment. We must. The future demands it of us.  
  
And that means we have to respond. I don’t know the solutions to the five crises, but I know where the answers can be found: in our own lives, our own minds and our own hands.  
  
I often refer to the Sanskrit word seva. It means selfless service. I think now, more than ever, we are all called to be sevadari. It translates as “one who gives service,” but I think a better translation is “human being.”  
  
That’s why, in my political retirement, I am relaunching a program that we started 11 years ago: Three Things for Canada.  
  
It’s simple. I am asking every citizen, every year, to do at least three acts of service, of seva. It can be something small (shovel your neighbour’s walk) or something big (join a non-profit board). It doesn’t matter.  
  
What matters is that our service to each other is how we mould that clay, how we create that future, how we move to solutions on our five crises.  
  
Eleven years ago, Calgarians took a big risk. They took a risk on a nerdy schlumpy professor to lead them, sure, but the real risk was on a better future.  
  
It’s been the honour of my life to have held in my hand, even for a moment, the hope and dreams, fears and challenges, of my fellow citizens.  
  
While politics lie behind me, I know that a better future lies ahead. For all of us.  
  
If we are bold enough to grab it.",hgmzyfz,t3_q83dvc,1634234440,1634259640.0,/r/alberta/comments/q83dvc/nenshi_reflects/hgmzyfz/,2021-10-14 18:00:40,2021-10

786,azthemansays,ontario,"&gt; The president of a union representing workers in long-term care, hospitals and retirement homes said **the staffing problem, driven by low wages, lack of full-time jobs and poor work conditions, predates the pandemic**, and vaccine mandates will likely add to it.

&gt; Dr. Kieran Moore, the province's top doctor, said Ontario is watching closely for the **""unintended consequence"" of staff shortages related to vaccine mandates but maintained that they are necessary** in some jobs to protect the vulnerable.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The head of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario said **the health staff shortage is ""a crisis of mega proportions"" that's largely unrelated to vaccine resistance.** But Doris Grinspun argued that **the impact of vaccine mandates could be mitigated if the province applied the policy across the entire health system.**

&gt; ""People need to work,"" Grinspun said in an interview. ""**How many will leave if it's across the the whole system?** Where are they going to go?""

797,BurstYourBubbles,ontario,"Phasing out Ontario’s natural gas power plants by the end of this decade is not feasible and would lead to rolling blackouts and soaring electricity bills, the body in charge of planning and operating the province’s power system said Thursday in a report that gas opponents have criticized as too pessimistic.

In the report, which responds to demands from municipalities to phase out natural gas by 2030, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) estimates it would cost $27-billion to build alternative generating facilities and transmission lines, plus additional operating costs of $5.7-billion a year, causing a typical homeowner’s monthly bill to skyrocket by an average of $100, or 60 per cent. Power shortfalls would lead to rotating outages during periods of high demand. And that, the report says, is a best-case scenario.

“The key message is that the 2030 timeline really just didn’t provide us with enough runway” to replace natural gas, said David Devereaux, the IESO’s senior manager of resource and plan assessments, during a technical briefing with reporters.

Mr. Devereaux said the IESO team “challenged themselves to make this work” and avoided dwelling on obstacles, but that coming up with a plausible scenario required them to make heroically optimistic assumptions. Those included taking for granted that Ontario could build the world’s largest energy storage network (more than 6,000 megawatts) in the next eight years, as well as secure an additional 3,300 megawatts of supply from Quebec. Those assumptions probably weren’t reasonable, Mr. Devereaux said.

“It’s been a very useful exercise, but not feasible in reality.”

Canada on pace to fall well short of 2030 climate commitment, report says

That message will disappoint many who have urged a rapid retreat from fossil-fuel power generation as a way of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. The report was the IESO’s response to more than 30 Ontario municipal councils (including those of Kitchener, Hamilton, Windsor, Mississauga and Toronto).

Nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams generate most of Ontario’s electricity. According to the IESO, gas plants represent nearly 30 per cent of the province’s total generation capacity, but they have been used primarily to bridge shortfalls when demand for electricity spikes, such as when a heat wave strikes Toronto and residents turn on their air conditioners. Consequently, they account for just 7 per cent of electricity actually produced.

That’s expected to change. IESO forecasts indicate the gas fleet will need to ramp up this decade to offset the retirement of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station (currently scheduled for 2024-25) and ongoing refurbishments of reactors at the Bruce and Darlington nuclear stations, which are expected to continue into the 2030s.

Until recently, natural gas was regarded as the fuel of choice for new power generation. It’s the cleanest-burning fossil fuel. Its other advantages include relatively short construction times for new plants and lower capital costs. And gas-fired plants have generally attracted less public opposition than new dams and nuclear plants. This led to a rapid buildout across North America, sometimes referred to as the “dash to gas.”

The same factors contributed to global growth. According to the International Energy Agency, natural gas accounts for nearly a quarter of global electricity generation, and it met one-third of global energy demand growth during the last decade – more than any other fuel.

But with industrial nations unveiling plans to achieve “net zero” emissions by mid-century or sooner, natural gas’s flame has dimmed considerably. In a commentary published last year, RMI, a U.S. energy think tank, said new gas-fired power plants “face ever-stronger financial headwinds,” while costs for renewable generation and storage continue to decline.

“Gas generation is now attracting only a small fraction of investor interest compared to clean energy and will soon likely see its market share decline accordingly,” RMI concluded.

The Ontario Clean Air Alliance is among the non-governmental organizations eager to see natural gas disappear entirely. The organization has encouraged municipal councils to lobby Queen’s Park to make that happen.

Jack Gibbons, the organization’s chair, said the IESO’s analysis was “fundamentally flawed” because it considered high-cost battery storage while ignoring more attractive options.

“They’re analyzing the most-expensive storage options they can think of, in an attempt to discredit the request for a gas plant phase-out,” he said.

“Ontario is located right next door to the largest battery in the world, Hydro Quebec’s reservoirs. And by 2030, the storage capacity of our electric vehicle batteries will be more than double the capacity of our gas plants. But they don’t analyze that option either.”

Richard Carlson, director of energy policy with Pollution Probe, agreed with the IESO’s conclusion that Ontario would be hard pressed to phase out natural gas by 2030. Part of the reason for the difficulty, he said, is that the province has never addressed key questions, such as what sort of power generation should replace the Pickering facility once it’s retired.

“If we are serious about meeting our climate commitments, we cannot burn unabated gas,” he said. “And we need a proper plan to get there.”

Mr. Carlson said he believes a 2035 deadline would be aggressive but feasible, “if we started planning for it now.”

Other observers expect that demand for natural gas will actually increase, as electrification of things like buildings and vehicles causes electricity demand to skyrocket. In a forecast published earlier this year, the Canada Energy Regulator projected that if actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, installed natural gas generation capacity will increase 70 per cent across the country between now and 2030. The increase would be far less – about 30 per cent – if nothing more is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond policies already in place today, mainly because there would be less need for new generation capacity.

In 2014, Ontario became the first jurisdiction to eliminate coal-fired generation from its electricity mix. The IESO had similar reservations about that transition: its report in 2006 said the provincial government’s plans to close coal-fired plants threatened system reliability and “will require significant delays.”",hft49q0,t3_q3ojd6,1633660564,1633685764.0,/r/ontario/comments/q3ojd6/risk_of_blackouts_higher_bills_if_ontario_sets/hft49q0/,2021-10-08 02:36:04,2021-10

The lock downs, and the people screaming for absolute lock down after lockdown after lockdown are usually the ones with minimum wage jobs, no kids or mortgages, not business owners, or anyone else with a solid career who will be just fine sitting on CERB playing video games in mom and dads basement.

Good for you for working harder for less hours. I did as well, pay cut for 6 months so we could stay in buisness.

But it's logical to think that many people were advocating lockdowns because it would either not effect them or would maybe even be beneficial financially to go on CERB and either suckle off the government tit and do noting or take the opportunity to get better educated to get a better job (which is awesome IMO).

Rather than just some ""moral superiority"" and claiming to ""just do the right thing"".

It was easy to prance around like some sort of social justice warrior for lockdowns when you would survive one, or benefit one. And then see people condemn those who would basically lose everything if we locked down again or kept locking down.

Lots of people are close to insolvency due to cost of living all the way to poor money management.

So yes, if locking down would have caused me to risk losing my home, ability to take care of my dependents, and maybe lose my retirement? Then yes I would be on team ""fuck the lockdown"" and would instead support any and every other way to properly control this pandemic which we are seeing now with passports and mandatory vaccination mandates.

802,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt; dying in their own piss and shit in private nursing homes run by Harris.

Painfully accurate. 

&gt;""Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) – including $4.29 million in 'deferred trust units' (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement)."" According to the article Chartwell's communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell's homes. 

&gt;&gt;""Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage,"" Unifor's website states. ""In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.""

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it's ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell's corporate boardroom while front line workers in homes are paid ""abysmal, poverty wages.""

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors' homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

They subsidies come from us, the tax payer. Ontario has a lot of tax payers. Signing on May upset a lot of Ontario tax payers.

Ford is a fuck up. A broken clock is right twice a day.

I think Pharma care (along with effective public healthcare and basic dental) should be a higher priory. No one should be financially fucked because of serious health issues which also compromises their their ability to earn a living - basically at the mercy of big pharma, insurance companies etc. A healthy population is also good for the economy. Health care for all is a basic human right for any civilized country.

Subsided daycare is basically a subsidy for businesses (rotten neoliberal status quo) who are increasingly not paying livable wages (decades of wage stagnation) and over priced speculative real estate (and other areas of increased cost of living driven by corporate greed - ROBELLUS etc) - and by extension high rental / mortgage costs (for businesses and individuals). Pensions have also been decimated with many relying on over priced real estate as their nest egg.

Fix those problems and people will be better able to support their families independently with a secure retirement like in the past. Believe it or not, the working class was able to raise a family on one salary and get ahead in the past! Now both partners have to work just to tread water with no security (precarious living) - for the majority of the lower working classes.

The fucking contempt for people who are not already their voters.  Even if they are brainwashed, you don't deprogram a voter by calling them a dumb piece of shit.

For one thing you need a political organization worth mentioning in every constituency, even the ones where you are only getting 10% of the vote.  Saskatchewan has created many new political movements from nothing, radical ones, and they were up against the same monied interests, the same media dominance by established parties, and devotion to the Churches was infinitely stronger.

Face to face interactions and meetings with voters is difficult and dangerous work, and political constituencies and social clubs are needed for mutual support of volunteers.  Again, this is old school stumping shit and it still works.

Now policies.  Well you have to look at what the Conservative government won't do.  The rail car fleet is breaking down and facing retirement, which will mean that the rail capacity will drop unless private industry steps in to supply it at a reasonable cost.  They don't give us enough engines as it is, and capacity has already begun to suffer.  The NDP could step in and campaign about how they take this seriously and will maintain and purchase new cars so that farmers will not be left to to the mercy of the oligarchy that runs the railways.

But hey, maybe this is a bad idea.  Maybe I'm a big dummy for suggesting that Saskatchewan have a plan for a publically maintained rail fleet to ensure that we can get grain to port.  But the fact that the NDP in the core of the party don't know about agriculture enough to know that there is an issue because they think agriculture is fucking farmer's markets... well that really shows they aren't acting in the interests of the widest swath of the population after all.",hfj1thl,t3_pzxpax,1633469280,1633494480.0,/r/saskatchewan/comments/pzxpax/why_is_the_saskparty_still_popular_in/hfj1thl/,2021-10-05 21:28:00,2021-10

830,DrunkenGolfer,NovaScotia,"First, I'll apologize for the cold reception from fellow redditors in this sub.  The sub is moderated with a light touch and has a disproportionate number of mouthpieces who are bitter at the world and not at all representative of the Nova Scotia population at large.  They just can't bring themselves to scroll to the next post without barking.

Being surrounded by water and near the Gulf Stream, weather in Nova Scotia is relatively mild compared to most of Canada, probably colder than BC.  It can be highly volatile, largely because when the air masses move from the interior, they are bitter cold, but 80% of the time the weather moves the other way, so warmer ocean air.  Expect things to hover around freezing for most of the winter months with short stretches of spring-like weather and short stretches of really cold weather.  Halifax gets 25 snow days per year with 154cm of snow.   
 Kentville gets very nearly double that amount of snow at 51 days and 263cm of snow.   
 Running generally won't be a challenge most of the time, and when it is a challenge, duration will be measured in days not months, especially where trail systems exist.

There are several raceways, so as a gear head, you should be fine.  ATVs and side-by-sides are pretty popular too with robust trail networks.

My wife and I are early fifties, originally from Nova Scotia, but have been absent for 16 years or so.  We moved to Falmouth, which is a couple exits closer to the city than Wolfville and the gateway to the Annapolis Valley.  I don't think you'd regret Wolfville as a choice.  Although a university town, it isn't overwhelmed by the university population and the university brings a lot of options, events, and services you might not otherwise get in a small town.  No shortage of restaurants, although not many good fine dining options.  There is enough arts and culture to make it interesting, there is a great farmer's market and enough shops and services to make it convenient.  Just a few minutes up the road is New Minas, which is the retail capital of the Annapolis Valley, home of all the big-box stores you might need.  All very conveniently located.    The whole area has a number of parks and walking trails, also good for running and cycling.

As far as being accepted socially, well, that depends on you.  There is no shortage of xenophobia, especially in more rural parts, but common interests and time will overcome a lot of that.

As far as healthcare, forget about it.  Healthcare is best described as death prevention, which means most resources are dedicated to the seriously ill and anything else has wait times that mean you'll never heal properly from an injury or enjoy more than 1/2 of your retirement years if you have things like bad knees or hips.  Access to ERs and walk-ins is OK in the Annapolis Valley area, but doctors are a five-year waiting game.

If you think you might like the Annapolis Valley, I'd highly suggest renting somewhere central, like maybe Kentville, and then checking out towns and villages in all directions before you make a commitment.

It's been a very long time since jobs that provided an opportunity for growth and advancement were common. If what I see around me is representative of the common experience, those kinds of jobs have all but vanished.

Very few service and labour jobs have access to much in the way of meaningful advancement. Neither do they have schedules or remuneration that allow for much in the way of education and training.

841,Dextervvegte,alberta,"Finally a sane comment thread. What we really need to see is public health and the media start using real meaningful statistics rather than (while technically factually true) misleading statistics like painting it solely as a Vax vs unvax issue when reality is it that is way more a behavior issue. Yes unvaxed are making up a disproportionate portion of hospitalizations but this is more related to the fact that most of those who refuse to engage in responsible behavior are unvaxed not solely that they are unvaxed. If we broke down behavior in unvaxed and behavior in vaxed I'd just about guarantee that it would quickly become obvious it's more of behavior problem than a Vax status problem. But they won't admit that for some reason. They'd rather destroy relationships between sane rational people who have the pros and cons and made a decision that they thought best for themselves at the moment based on all facts (including personal ones that they in no way should be forced to publicly share) instead of calling out and highlighting the real problem.
I have a friend who suffered a few massive strokes soon after his second dose. It forced him to early retirement even though he was counting on 5 more years to build his retirement and left him almost blind in one eye. Did the Vax cause his stroke? Did it just accelerate something already brewing? Did it have nothing to do with it? We don't have that answer. The fact is he chose to get vaxed because his (adult) daughter is immunosuppressed even though he works from home and other than a roughly weekly grocery trip doesn't go out in public much and mostly only interacts with his daughter (who also takes extraordinary precautions and is also vaxed).

846,tutamtumikia,alberta,"Fair enough.  There are absolutely elements of what you say in the space.  I completely agree.  I feel you're really underselling some of the really smart projects that do exist and are being run by smart teams.  

I think there are very reasonable conversations to be had about things like decentralized finance and it's place.  I think huge numbers of people also have no understanding about basic things like how to pay their taxes.  Next year is going to be a disaster for a lot of folks who think that they won't have to account for any of their paper gains and only need to pay taxes if they actually cash out.

This is an issue of education, and it exists in the traditional finance world as well.  I mean wallstreetbets is a thing, but I don't claim that the entire stock market is scam because a loud reddit community does their thing.  

Regulation is coming, and personally I think it's a very good thing for the space as it will help legitimize it.  

I also think that a lot of people are tired of being taken advantage of and are willing to risk their OWN money for their OWN opportunities.  Lots are going to get wrecked, but a lot of people are going to become financially free as well.  I support their right to take chances with their OWN money.

I still make my monthly deposits into my RRSP account.  I think there is a place for it.  But if you can't see why people might be a little tired of Gary Gensler telling people to save $5 a week to end up with $165,000 at retirement then I think you're really out of touch.  It's laughable and insulting coming from a guy who has a net worth in the 10s to 100s of millions of dollars.

In short, the space is new and ripe for people taken advantage of.  Totally agree.  It's also filled with a lot of smart and hard working people who actually want to help make the world better.

At 72 the forced withdrawal is in the 5% range and ramps up to over 20% by the time you are 95 (if you live that long).

So it is possible that u/jinxxedbyu2's parents have a RIF that requires them to withdraw more than they actually need for covering their expenses.

- Increasing capital gains - this is only taxed on the actual profit, and wouldn't affect any money already invested. As well, almost everyone can retire pretty comfortably on RRSP and TFSAs, neither of which tax capital gains.
- Corporate income tax cuts - irrelevant if you're retired
- 15% tax on excess pandemic income - irrelevant if you're retired
- Marginal tax rate increase - probably irrelevant if you're retired, unless your retirement plans somehow require that your parent's combined yearly budgets for retirement are $420,000, in which case I have absolutely no sympathy.
- Wealth tax on multi-millionaires - it's hard to say since there isn't a definition of ""multi-millionaires"", but assuming this was even $5 million, your parents can still have a comfortable retirement before that wealth tax even applies.

934,dontthrowmeaway40,PEI,"TLDR: If you are absolutely dead set on being a lawyer, go to the cheapest school possible. 

The economics of law school in Canada don’t make sense. Unless you are one of the “lucky” few who get a Bay Street job, it makes zero economic sense to borrow six figures to become a lawyer. Many lawyers at small firms and/or in smaller regions will take many years to reach even a low six figure salary. And those “good” Bay Street jobs will work you to death. A lot of associates burn out and leave big law well before hitting the partnership jackpot. 

Law schools are big money for universities, but a rip off for many or most students. Everyone who gets in is smart and driven and used to being at the top of their class. But someone has to be at the bottom of the law school rankings, and half of those smart, driven 1Ls will be the bottom half of their class. And no one thinks it will be them. Meanwhile, firms want to see straight As only.

New law schools keep opening, but there aren’t enough jobs to go around. So ontario had to start an alternative to articling for people who can’t get a job- drop even more cash on the University X program, with an often unpaid 4 month placement which isn’t long enough to learn much or make many connections to get a job. Then try convince someone to hire you despite many people seeing that alternative as decidedly second tier.

It was damn hard graduating 16 years ago without articles and high 5 figures debt. I couldn’t find work at all on PEI and ended up moving to Toronto and doing my articles pro bono. For a while I was doing real estate law, making maybe $1000 before expenses on deals where the real estate agents were splitting a &gt;50k commission! 

I did land eventually in a very good government job, but it took years to get to a salary that could justify the debt. And over 10 years to pay it off. So saving for retirement and buying a home are delayed by years of extra school plus years of paying off debts from school. 

Now I meet young graduates with 200k debt. They literally can’t afford even a crappy basement apartment, and it will take decades to claw their way out of that debt.

Liberals are especially married to the idea that their party is ""the progressive one"", despite the total lack of progressive outcomes even though the Liberals have been in power for most of the last 40 years.

The poor keep getting poorer, the rich keep getting richer. The cost of living keeps going higher, wages are not keeping up. Canada is now a country of haves and have-nots.

The Liberals and the Conservatives have together created a Canada in which no amount of hard work will net you a stable life and a comfortable retirement. The only route to home ownership is rich parents.

if you have signed an employment agreement that references the ESA (employment standards act) as it relates to severance, you **may** be limited to that.

if you have a signed contract that has its own severance provisions, it must be better than the ESA to be binding.

if you have no contract or no specific wording in the contract regarding severance, then you go to Common Law.

This website (and there are many others that have a similar discussion) [https://www.monkhouselaw.com/severance-pay-ontario/](https://www.monkhouselaw.com/severance-pay-ontario/) talks about all this.

&amp;#x200B;

example from that link.

By way of example: under the Employment Standards Act, an older employee nearing retirement who worked for their employer for 15 years would be entitled to **8 weeks** in termination pay, with the potential for an **additional 15 weeks**’ pay if their employer had a payroll of over $2.5 million or there was a mass termination.  **However, if that employee had not signed an employment contract, or if their contract’s termination clause violated the Act, they would be entitled to common law severance pay**.  Then, their severance package **could be as much as 24 months** of pay, depending on the circumstances.

by the way, even if you signed some sort of severance agreement it may not be enforceable by the employer.  example:  you got a job and signed an employment agreement.  later (say the next day), they shove an addendum in your face that speaks to severance.  you sign, but they didn't give you anything for signing.  you already have the job, so that doesn't count.  to make the agreement binding they have to give something of value.  It's quite likely that that second document would get tossed and then you are into common law.

1005,Kizznez,ontario,"I'll bite. I'm under 30, and fall under the same. The main reasons so far, have been because I don't think the working people should be taxed more, and the liberal and NDP platforms always tend to be big $$$. Last election during the debates the liberals and NDP both agreed on stage that they wouldn't be able to fund their environmental plans. I think there is severe bloat in the government - lots of high salaries employees that don't do much, a ridiculous amount of red tape, and slow to adapt. Cons have always had a ""cut unnecessary spending in govt"" part of the platform, although I don't agree with cutting education or healthcare. I was disappointed when Trudeau walked back voter reform, legal weed was good, even if I can't smoke it. When Trudeau said he was a ""figure head"" and not a leader, I just can't bring myself to vote for him. 

Green party was a joke. Elizabeth May thought wifi gave cancer. Yikes. 

NDP - always liked Jack Layton as a teen. Singh seems decent, but I struggle to see how his big dreams can be funded without slapping me with higher taxes. As someone who's young and investing for retirement since I don't have a government pension, increasing capital gains tax to affect 75% of gains will hurt me long term, while not affecting the people 50-65 who already made their gains (who also have all the money). 

Most people are swayed by a single issue. As a hunter, I also think Trudeau's restriction of guns is ridiculously unspecific, and our Restricted and Non-Restricted system works fairly well, seeing as most gun crime comes from illegal handguns. I'm not against banning handguns, but their legislation is vague and leaves the door open for them to target my bolt-action, single shot hunting rifles, which I'm not okay with. Add this to all the scandals of the liberals the last 6 years, and it's essentially either CPC or NDP, and I don't think the NDP can realistically fund their plan.

TL:dr: people are generally single issue voters, liberals had a lot of scandals, NDP plans are $$$ with low chance of achieving funding goals",hcg4wf6,t3_pm6y4k,1631376088,1631401288.0,/r/ontario/comments/pm6y4k/how_did_you_otoole_win_leadership_of_his_party_if/hcg4wf6/,2021-09-11 16:01:28,2021-09

1013,Redditcider,alberta,"Keep in mind that baseline was 173 beds and right now they are up to 169 COVID ICU patients.  In general there are not ICU nurses just standing around without jobs, so the extra beds are generally made by redeploying nurses what have a similar skillset OR who previously worked in the ICU but left (some voluntarily, others imposed) to go work in the new units.  These are usually operating room nurses, emergency room nurses, and sometimes the medical and surgical floors - essentially those with critical care training.  That then causes the areas they have stolen from to have to cut activities (as there nurses are reduced) and combined with your usual medical/surgical beds being filled up with COVID patients, you have less beds available for routine care.  


This is why you see surgeries being cut.  The operating room nurses are being stolen, the surgical beds are being converted into medical COVID beds or general medical beds as other medical areas get converted to COVID areas.  When the crap is really hitting the fan (which I bet is occurring right now or very, very soon) you run out of areas where you can isolate the covid patients with negative pressure or sufficient distance.  So you start getting recovery room areas converted to mini-ICUs (happened in my area) and this further reduces your surgical capacity as you now have to recover your surgical patients inside the operating room.  


Our area has still not recovered above 60% operating room activity since the pandemic and we are not even in the 4th wave.  Our nurses are taking early retirement, nursing jobs outside the hospital where they are not forced to work 16h shifts or 1 weekend in 2, or deal with the antivaxers who are f-ing it all up.

Maybe it’s changed since I worked for SHA(support staff, not medical) but the “job” is a set schedule for a specific department.

Seems to me it’s just saying that most nurses haven’t yet got the position they want to stay in long term.

There was so much home repair required that my wife and I drained a fair amount of our retirement savings in order to fix the home.

So while we are able to build equity in this home, and take advantage of whatever price increase happens over the next 20 years or whatever, it's debatable whether that would have been better than simply renting, saving all the maintenance and repair costs, and then investing those funds. 

With good investment and a sensible rent, what you save and invest could be used to generate probably nearly as much as a home price rise.

The cost of borrowing has been super low for a long time now, meaning that real estate has climbed like crazy since a) mortgages are cheap and b) savings have low returns so there's pressure to invest. Rent is in turn influenced by the price of buying.

Also ups the incentive to move here. Say ns prices are 1/2 of Toronto prices, and that stayed constant. If the average house in Toronto was 250k, you could move and have 125k left over, which would be nice but not retirement. But if the Toronto house was 1m, you are then left with 500k.

They’ve done almost nothing whatsoever, big or small, on the only issue that matters to me right now and that matters to most young millennials and younger generations - housing affordability.

Rents are raising year over year. Salaries and wages are still stagnant for even highly educated, complex fields like engineering. Housing is still going to the moon and it’s no longer just limited to metrovancouver and the GTA. Boomers and some Gen X are sitting pretty in their cheaply bought homes valued over a million dollars now in many cases. Many of these people have more than one property. They’re drawing their equity on using HELOCs and either buying more properties for themselves or buying for their kids or grandchildren, creating an even more unlevel playing field than ever before. Immigration is ramping up at 400,000 new Canadians annually, and that’s directly contributing to vast increased demand for all kinds of housing - rental and ownership, while supply is pathetically low and barely increasing. 

My generation is now being told to just be happy renting for life to some boomer or to some boomer’s kids who only own because their parents helped them. My generation is being told now that if you don’t come from a family that can aid you into the market, just fuck off and work your 9-5 and pay 30%+ of your income to rent and shut up until you die.

NDP is going to have a good run this time around due to support from millennials and GenZ who come from less well-off backgrounds - because we all see the “Canadian dream” slipping away permanently. Nobody can convince me that renting for life is a good thing for your long-term life. The boomers get to cash out their houses if they need to for funding their late life. If they don’t cash out, they still get to collect rent from their single property’s basement suites if necessary, or their additional properties’ out of simple self-serving nature. Millennials are barely going to have  jack shit when it comes to retirement if they didn’t get lucky in some way - scored a crazy paying job, partnered up with a decent earning spouse, got into the property market using parental aid, etc etc etc. 

If you take the time to talk to young people now, you might just find that a lot of what I’ve written in this comment is popular sentiment that is just suppressed and not outwardly spoken. After all, there’s still millions of people out there who seem to think millennials are lazy and just need to work harder to buy a home.

A small time landlord like this is just trying to save for retirement and boost their income a bit. There are so many misconceptions of how lucrative owning rentals can be. After factoring in expenses, a duplex will only leave you a couple hundred or few hundred bucks extra per month. The money earned is through principal recapture and not usually realized until later on when sold. One big repair can take away 1-2 years of NOI. 

This whole “us vs them” thing that goes on is so toxic and unhelpful. Not all landlords are bad, not all tenants are good.

Best of all, no one seems to be even able to wrap their heads around the concept that, at the end of the day, both the vaccine is extremely low risk and COVID-19 is extremely low-risk in children.

And frankly, either way it barely matters.  We're spending a remarkable amount of energy over something that will in practical terms mean ... perhaps a dozen children dying nationally if we pick the wrong one, whatever the wrong one turns out to be.  More will die in a car crash this month.  It's quite possible more will die in traffic on their way to the vaccination clinics.

House needs a full gut job, and he drives an hour to work (which he found after buying the house and leaving Ontario).  He felt the same way as OP- there isn’t a future here anymore.  My dad retired after 3 divorces, and was renting. In order to retire he had to leave Ontario as well. He worked his whole life but a heart attack in his mid 60s made him reevaluate. He moved to New Brunswick with my brother and is really loving it, not to mention he is ABLE to retire there. 

Massive change needs to happen in ON or we will continue to loose a mass of our workforce who says fuck this.  

I bought a home with my SO last April 2020 for 473k, gorgeous new built outside London 2000sq ft.  Same house is now selling for 900k. I lost my job to covid and found it nearly impossible to find anything making over 50k - I used to make 90k. My spouse makes around 150k. Between the two of us, we should have a comfortable life, but we’ve been watching the cost of EVERYTHING go up and also feel that this trajectory only has us spending more and more for less and less. Retirement savings, investments, travel are not something we can pour money into the way we need to to you know, retire one day. And still we know how lucky we are to have what we have. 

Now my SO really wants a baby but he and I are both looking at finances and aren’t sure how we will afford childcare, much less justify it. Plus I have PCOS which means IVF is a very possible and expensive possibility. We are in our early 30s. 

If you have the ability to change province’s or countries, do it.

It’s my opinion that people that qualify for OAS did behave badly. Everyone knows they should save for retirement, but some don’t. Similar to smokers knowing smoking is bad, but they don’t quit. But we still provide health care to smokers.

Both OAS and the $100 are aimed at people who knowingly did not do the right thing, and both are getting rewarded with taxpayer funded money. 

My spouse originally had the same position as this sub. But now they realize, it’s not perfect, or fair, but the outcome should be more positive than it is presently.

1079,ClusterMakeLove,alberta,"I think we're agreed that the policy ought to be utilitarian, if that's what you're actually saying. I just think you're being a bit narrow in your thinking. 

You seem to be treating this as a choice between positive vaccine incentives and doing nothing. Or that we can only do one thing at a time to promote vaccination. Neither are really true.

The problem isn't offering a financial incentive to vaccinate. It's doing it in September instead of April. It's doing nothing for the entire month of August while nobody seemed to be in charge. It's lacking the basic respect for the vaccinated to explain to them why an unfair policy is needed to save lives. That's where the anger is coming from. C'mon-- surely that's pretty obvious, right? 

All of this falls into a pattern of making an obvious wrong decision, ignoring criticsm, and then feigning complete bafflement when things don't work out. Oil prices. Keystone. COVID testing. Labour relations. The list goes on. They're always so stunned by the obvious consequences of their actions. Add that together, and I'm almost incoherent with how angry I am.

But still, if I thought this would help, I'd support it. The problem is it won't.

ICUs are maxed out and whatever we do, it's going to take time to start working. There should be a sense of urgency, and we're talking about giving someone gas money. This is more about creating a pretense that they're taking some action. The mask mandate will do far more to help than this will, and I'll at least give credit there. But again, why did they ever lift it? What harm was it doing?

I think your CPP metaphor is a bit poorly conceived. CPP is an entitlement that people pay into. It's their own money. Being unvaccinated is a silly choice. We don't withhold medical care from the unvaccinated, just like we provide basic dignity to people who don't save for retirement. 

Nobody is talking about killing these people. I just don't want them teaching my kids or taking care of my elderly relatives, or making it less safe for a vaccinated person to work or participate in society. Exclusion from certain high-risk aspects of society, until they get their acts together or the crisis passes.

Irving came around and signed a deal where they would cut the wood for them, then give them the majority of the profits from the wood in exchange. The idea being irving makes most of their money once the wood is cut into lumber and sold rather than by the stump. The older guy agreed and over the next six months to a year irving came in every day to clear cut the area.

When it was finally cleared the old man waited for his check to come. Kept waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Finally, one day he checked his mail and got a letter from Irving. But istead of a check it was a bill. Irving charged them to build the roads into the woods so the equipment could go in to work since the roads were on his land, he had to pay for it. So after they took the profits off the top of the cost to construct this road they still owed like 20k. So instead of having his retirement money, he got a bill/debt of 20k and irving got arches upon arches of pristine wood. For free

That's how irving works. And I'm certain others have had similar things happen to them.",hbhncc4,t3_ph7k4i,1630701028,1630726228.0,/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/ph7k4i/eli_5_the_irvings/hbhncc4/,2021-09-03 20:30:28,2021-09

Porters at the maximum seniority pay band are making 54 cents less per hour than in PEI.

“For years, provincial government has tried to hold a mandate of wage restraint that has set our members back. We are hosting this conference to align our forces to fight for wages at the bargaining tables. It has become the number one priority for most, because overall, workers’ pay has not followed cost of living increases for the last 10 years,” said Daniel Légère, President of CUPE NB.

Previous negations with public sector unions have been marked two consecutive wage restraint mandates, meaning weak or no wage increases: 0% and 1% were the norm.

https://nb.cupe.ca/2018/03/21/breaking-the-mandate-in-new-brunswick/ 

From the OP's cbc article. 
In a statement, Higgs said CUPE had refused to budge from a demand for five-per-cent annual wage increases over four years ""and was planning strike votes for next week while we were at the table this week.

In his statement Friday, Higgs said the province had made a new offer of annual increases of 1.25 per cent over six years.

The statement also said the province offered an extra 2.5 per cent wage increase if members agreed to give up a retirement allowance that now exists.

The last quote is interesting, Higgs offered a one time 2.5 percent increase to replace severance pay.

In the collective agreement linked above 
 ARTICLE 34 - RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE:
34.01 When an employee having continuous service of 9,787.5 hours or more retires in accordance with the
pension plan in effect at the time, or has his employment terminated due to disability, death, age or is laid off, the 
- 29 -
hospital shall pay such an employee or beneficiary a severance allowance equal to 37.5 hours’ pay for each 1,957.5
hours of continuous service, but not exceeding 937.5 hours’ pay, at the employee's regular rate of pay. In the case of
layoff, such payment will only take place at the end of the eighteen (18) month period provided for under Article
20.06.

People are looking for services where there are no longer workers to fill demand. French speaking requirements have historically meant that skilled paramedics who didn't speak French have been turned away or could only be hired 'temporarily'. Many industries are running into this problem in NB, but Health Care is especially feeling it. Then COVID hits and healthcare workers and admin staff (short staffed as they already were) were worked overtime (I personally had vacation time cancelled and know others who did as well) and made to follow restrictions that stressed them out further. Pop-up COVID clinics and endless testing has diverted manpower that would have been used elsewhere. Lockdowns added even more stress. I know several people who took hits to their pensions just to leave the industry (they'd make up the difference elsewhere). Also, economies in other provinces have driven people to move to NB for cheaper living, which drove up the housing demands here (costs are now shooting up and shortages are in place never thought possible). Higher lumber costs are driving up housing costs too. New people are creating a greater demand for family doctors but have not yet been paying into the tax base here so there's a natural lag for funding for more doctors. So more demand on healthcare which puts more stress on workers. It's a vicious cycle and this isn't even the half of it.

1130,humanefly,ontario,"I'm interested in a relatively recent vehicle technology called Wing In Ground or Ground Effect Vehicle. Think of it as an air hockey puck. The air hockey puck floats on a cushion of air, so there is no rolling resistence. The WIG is designed so that forward movement forces a bubble of air under the craft, it lifts up and floats on the trapped bubble. It's more efficient than car, boat or plane. It has specific limitations: it can only fly above the water, and it's a rough landing in bad weather but there are several recent technologies that mitigate the issues, including LIDAR or the ability to have computers detect wave heights and control height above the water. 

The idea I have in mind is to change my lifestyle to focus on living and working on or near the water. It has the potential to open up land that does not have roads. 

I know that many people who are focused on mass transport don't like the idea of private vehicles really, but I think Canada has a lot of land, and a lot of water. Living on the Great Lakes we're in a perfect place to benefit and profit from this technology. 

The main limitation of landing in bad weather being uncomfortable for travellers could be mitigated not just by computer control, but by creating protected ""landing strips"" that are sheltered from the wind and waves. 

There are several recent advances in technology that make these vehicles much more feasible. 

I watched my neigbhour build his own plane in his garage, haul the parts to the cottage and assemble it; now he has a plane. However, aircraft engines are not cheap; aircrafts need regular maintenance and aircraft mechanics are not cheap, jetfuel is not cheap and so on. With these vehicles you can use a car or boat engine and a regular mechanic, and regular fuel. They would be more fuel efficient than a regular drone.

I wrote to Transport Canada and asked: do you need a pilots license to fly a WIG? I asked both the regular pilot department and the drone department and they both said that they do not fly according to the definition of flight; they can do short vertical hops of several hundred feet but it's terribly inefficient once they leave ground effect. You need a Pleasure Craft or boating license. So, I'm thinking about getting my boating license and a glider license for experience, and building a drone. Then I'll build a bigger drone. Once I've logged some flight time I'll get in the drone and use it as the control base. It's a retirement project. It's important to have a dream,

Under the HBP you have to take out the 35k to use it towards your down payment.  So yes, I agree that you will have $45,000 to use for a down payment - the $35,000 contribution and the \~$10,000 refund.  This would leave $0 in your RRSP and $2916 to pay back every year for 15 years.  Where is the $70,000 coming from?

The power of the RRSP is that the money inside the RRSP is growing tax free.   
 When you take the funds out of your RRSP and use the refund from the contribution for your down payment there is no growth.  The opportunity cost is the many years of compounding growth of the invested money.

As you slowly pay it back, you could invest, but after 15 years paying back $194.44/month you would have $56,829.52 assuming an annual 6% return.  Alternatively, if you left the $35,000 invested for 15 years at 6%, and never contributed again, it would have grown to $85,893.27.

The idea behind the RRSP is that you are investing before tax dollars to grow tax free, only to be taxed when you withdraw.  If your tax rates are the same when you contribute and withdraw, the RRSP essentially is the same as a TFSA.  But if you use the HBP you are losing out on many years of compounding growth that can be essential for retirement.  The only way you ""save"" money with an RRSP is if you contribute at a much higher tax rate than when you withdraw.  And generally speaking, someone will be making their highest income shortly before they retire (and not when they are in their 20s/30s buying their first house).

Then of course if you don't make a payment in the year the missed payment is brought back into your income and you lose the RRSP contribution room forever.  In addition, when you repay the HBP you don't get a second deduction on your tax return.

Contributing to your RRSP solely for the use of the HBP is not a good idea, if you have been investing in your RRSP for many years and have no other means for a down payment, then maybe.  But if you otherwise weren't going to contribute to your RRSP if it weren't for the HBP, the average person is generally better off to wait and save their RRSP contribution room when they are in a higher tax bracket.",ha7a17h,t3_pasgc9,1629834458,1629859658.0,/r/ontario/comments/pasgc9/why_would_we_need_a_taxfree_first_home_savings/ha7a17h/,2021-08-24 19:47:38,2021-08

&gt;“Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) — including $4.29 million in ‘deferred trust units’ (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement).” According to the article, Chartwell’s communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it’s ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell’s corporate boardroom while front-line workers in homes are paid “abysmal, poverty wages.”

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors’ homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

1152,thrwnawyawkemu,britishcolumbia,"I usually lurk but this issue irks me enough to provide an answer. I'm probably incorrect in various aspects and may be ignorant of some relevant information but I wanted to try to apply a simplified opinion.

1. The fee for service incentivizes seeing as many people as possible and it's capped at 50. The fee for a service is somewhat age dependent but it isn't great and has been essentially eroded by inflation over the past 20 years. Due to healthcare costs, nobody really wants to increase this amount.

2. Because of the above, it's a loss to see people with multiple issues. Makes sense to see them over several days which takes multiple appointments and is generally inefficient. Most family practices tend to accumulate older people with multiple issues while younger people rather just see someone faster on a walk in basis. With increased complexity of patients that find it hard to make multiple appointments, it makes sense to do easy walk in than full family. 

3. To combat walk in and fee for service, the province put in some longitudinal fees so that if you see the same doctor and have certain conditions, they get a bonus. Problem is memorizing all the cryptic rules to make sure you get the bonus or having your patients come in less frequently or see someone else and your once a year bonus is gone. Trying to get these fees is like sending in mail in rebates - bunch of hoops to just get a small top off. The government could help here by having msp automate things but why make billing and charting easier for doctors? That way you can pay them less and say it was on their end.

4 Lots of audits and certain better paying codes have strict requirements in charting and what is done. A lot of people don't necessarily complete the requirements for charting or the time taken makes the better paying code worth less than a general visit. Most people then don't use these specialized fee codes to help with counselling and full physicals and just use a general code which goes back to number 1 - see as many people as possible for as fast as possible.

5 rent and salaries aren't cheap in bc. A good cut of money made goes to this. Then you pay the tax man. Then you get your bit to keep except add in your disability, medical/dental, malpractice, and other association fees. Then throw in a high cost of rent. Put in number 1-4 above which makes your work pay less and it seems more obvious that bc isn't the place to be it you want to be planning a reasonable retirement (you basically save since there is no pension) or want to spend time with family, etc. Hence fewer family practice docs that are actually doing fully service family.

The younger generation has income not sufficient to catch up to market inflation, however if they do qualify for a mortgage, at least the current cost of borrowing is way lower. It is much harder to generate sufficient income now, and many expenses are out of pocket for the younger generation that were included in public health care and/or employment benefits during the previous generations.

1170,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt;Harris has profited a lot from his part-time boardroom-based job with Chartwell. According to Martin Regg Cohn, writing in the Toronto Star, Harris was paid $229,500 last year.

&gt;The Star also reports that “Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) — including $4.29 million in ‘deferred trust units’ (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement).” According to the article, Chartwell’s communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it’s ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell’s corporate boardroom while front-line workers in homes are paid “abysmal, poverty wages.”

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors’ homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

1185,ExpenseThrowawayz,alberta,"Former Torontonian here. First, the economics of Calgary are pretty good in terms of cost of living, wages, and taxes. Alberta is best when you make a high income - $110,000+. If you make lower income 40-50k, you will actually pay more income tax here than in BC or Ontario. However, there is no sales tax and housing prices are low enough it to still be worth it. Housing appreciation sucks here compared to ON and BC though. You may find yourself in a situation where you buy a house here and 10 years later not being able to afford to trade that house in for one in Ontario.

Yes the climate is really bad and likely to get worse. We had a week of -40C in the winter. This summer we had not one, not two, but FOUR heatwaves with upwards of +40C at the worst. We've also had almost two months of bad smoke, with a few days in the super high risk Beijing-esque zone. That's smoke blowing in from both SK and BC, AND occassionally a local idiot will set some AB trees on fire too like they did in Canmore recently. Also, Alberta rivers are in the habit of flooding. There was a major flood in Calgary 10 years ago causing billions in damage.

The job market is probably about the same between Simcoe and Calgary, but please do understand that your rights as a worker are much much stronger in Ontario than in Alberta. Hope you don't get injured at work. You can read about their recent Bill 47 changes further.

Your rights as a tenant are much weaker compared to Ontario. For example, in Alberta there is no ceiling to rent increases. This has resulted in someone I know getting a rent increase of $700/month during the boom times. You got pets? Forget about it. You have no rights in that area and you can be evicted for sneaking them in, unlike in Ontario. Alberta is an Ontario landlord's wet dream though if you're planning on that route.

You may be aware that Alberta's government has been the least competent at handling the pandemic, with per capita numbers among the highest in North America at some point. You may not be aware that until just a few day ago, they were going to drop masking, testing, and contract tracing. Recent upticks from 50 cases a day to 500 in just 3 weeks have changed their minds. But they are also cutting health care funding and have fired health care workers and are continuing firing health care workers right now, during the pandemic, and nothing will change their minds about that. We're about to enter the 4th wave and with the massive numbers of anti-vaxxers (probably the highest in the country), I predict that Alberta will set new records of dead and infected. Post-covid, health care here will definitely be worse off, though you might still get an upgrade by moving from Simcoe to Calgary simply because its a big city.

Do you have children or plan on having them? The government here is wasting many millions making a right-wing propaganda document the new curriculum. Also they are doing everything possible to block the $10 day care initiative. 

Crime in the prairies is bad compared to everywhere else in Canada, but Calgary isn't actually that bad. The thing you have to watch out for is mainly property crime. That doesn't preclude you from being robbed or randomly attacked by some addict though.

Do you plan on relying on the CPP for retirement? Well, this government wants to take over the CPP, one of the most well-managed and actuarially sound pension plans in Canada, and hand it over to their cronies over at AIMCO. If you don't know the finance world, AIMCO is famously incompetent. Example: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/aimco-kevin-uebelein-jason-kenney-pensions-alberta-1.5552562

For a lot of people, the money overshadows the awful politics and the terrible weather. For me, the money is good and I'll stick around until it isn't. If they hand over the CPP to AIMCO, I'm 100% leaving. 

Also, the lakes in Alberta suck absolute balls compared to Ontario. They are full of algae and hazardous like 90% of the time.

This is a lot easier said than done. And if you can't find a job that facilitates this you still need to make money to survive in our society, so you need a source of income regardless. I do agree though, we are trapped, there's not really a choice, work or starve. 

&gt;I know way too many bored wealthy retired folks. I know a few people that could retire, but enjoy their work way too much. Imagine a retired trades person, that does a few select jobs per year. No financial stress. The money going towards taking the grand kids on a vacation. Plus they still teach those around them, so you get folks taking a pay cut to work with them.

There are people who love to work, my dad can't sit still for more than 5 minutes at home. To reach retirement you need a certain amount of money to be able to afford to live after you retire, so money does play the largest factor in retirement.

It also provides flexibility.  You don't have to pay severance for laying off a worker when they are no longer needed.

1215,grizzlyaf93,ontario,"I feel like a lot of people are focusing on the idea that rural folks are conflating the “Liberal” party name with progressive ideas and saying that they’re largely socially conservative. I feel like that’s partially true, but “conservative” in rural southwestern Ontario anyway is also pretty anti-government in general. 

I see conservatives down here very similarly to the “Dont tread on me” Americans and it borders on like pseudo-libertarianism. They want the government to police some things (ie pro-life signs litter the roads down here) but otherwise they want them out of their business all together. They vote Conservative because they feel they’re the ones that will “butt out” so to speak. Then, when a conservative is elected, they absolutely do butt out! In the form of not providing any sort of funding to social safety nets or infrastructure projects that connect this part of Ontario to the rest of it. This doesn’t affect large chunks of voters out here because they are either generationally wealthy and wouldn’t need a social safety net or a high speed train to large city centres (think farmers, people Inheriting large swathes of land) or isolated enough that they don’t realize things could be better. Then the cycle continues. 

I don’t like to boil rural southern Ontario down to “they hate progressives and anyone different than them” because I do think demographics are changing quickly out here. But I do think that most people who actively vote (emphasis on that) are the people who are generally unaffected by the lack of suitable representation from our MPs and MPPs.

&gt;  
&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) and numerous academic and public-health bodies have stated that the proposed strategy is dangerous and lacks a sound scientific basis.\[8\]\[9\] They say that it would be challenging to shield all those who are medically vulnerable, leading to a large number of avoidable deaths among both older people and younger people with pre-existing health conditions,\[10\]\[11\] and they warn that the long-term effects of COVID-19 are still not fully understood.\[9\]\[12\] Moreover, the WHO says that the herd immunity component of the proposed strategy is undermined by the limited duration of post-infection immunity.\[9\]\[12\] The more likely outcome, they say, would be recurrent epidemics, as was the case with numerous infectious diseases before the advent of vaccination.\[11\] The American Public Health Association and 13 other public-health groups in the United States warned in a joint open letter that the Great Barrington Declaration ""ignores sound public health expertise""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Barrington\_Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrington_Declaration)

Even Dr. Hinshaw does not support it and the Alberta Government website has a post from Dr. Hinshaw stating: 

&gt;""This is a very appealing statement to those who are tired of restrictions and in a context where the economic and social impacts of the restrictions are being felt keenly by those under 60, (“retirement age” is the cut off proposed in the Barrington document) who are at lower risk of severe outcomes. **Unfortunately, the claim that this approach is achievable with minimal impact is not correct for several reasons**.""

1232,LargeSnorlax,ontario,"Technically if people want McDonalds or Tims open during the day, they need people to work those shifts, that's service life.

However, the problem remains where you remain a McDonalds cashier for 30 years and never aspire or make changes to do something else with your career.

It's simple - You are not meant to work a minimum wage service job for your entire life, just like in a 20 year career like mine you are not meant to work in bottom shelf customer service for the entire 20 years. 

Minimum wage is intended for people to start off careers (students, recent immigrants) people building their job skills (people with no employment record, people looking to enter a trade/career) or end careers (people doing part time before retirement).

For instance, when I was 18, I worked as a Starbucks Barista to save my way through college. I got slightly above minimum wage at the time, $12 an hour or something as a supervisor (18 year old supervisor, also lol, would never fly today) and tips. That was decent money for the time. I worked there for a few years while putting myself through college. This is fine when you are just starting and learning.

However, if today, many decades later, I was still working as a Starbucks Barista, and complaining about how it's impossible to live in Ontario and how the government sucks, etc etc, I have bad news for myself - That's *my fault* for not learning, adapting, or developing skills to **at least** move up in Starbucks at the very minimum, let alone another job where I can actually use the skills I'm learning.

You also seem to be also misconstruing people making conscious choices to sacrifice when they don't need to vs. sacrificing because their previous decisions put them in a position where they had no choice. 

There is a lot of grey region in between and nothing is going to be a solution for everyone, but assuming that all (or even many) successful people are in their position because they had a head start is incorrect. 

Some of the sentiment on this thread sounds  a lot like my family. I've seen them squander opportunities that could've developed into great lives/retirement all because they wanted to keep feeling sorry for themselves and thinking that they are in their place because of others or 'the system'. They keep running on the hamster wheel because they divert all their thought and energy to feeling sorry for themselves and complaining rather than coming up with a plan, doing research and being actively productive. 

Everyone I grew up with came from working class families. We had to pay for our own education, cost of living, etc. Nobody had inheritance. I didn't get any advice from my parents or family. In fact, pretty much everyone that I am close to did not come a place of privilege, so my perspective is based on this group of people, for which I have lots of inside knowledge, rather than false assumptions.

1257,formesse,ontario,"Yes, I realize you are joking - but, if you are a Billionaire - the RESIDUAL INCOME you have just by letting your money sit in a bank account outstrips the cost of maintaining a moderate sized boat by such a large margin, it's not even funny.

Throw that money into investments and you could buy a homeless person a house every day - and still have so much money left over: knowing what to do with it, is difficult... so invest more.

Being a millionaire is relatively easy - Own a house, don't have a debt on it, and have a decent retirement fund and... congratulations, in plenty of western places: you are worth over a million. In reality, a million dollars is NOT a lot of money - but if you don't have it locked away in a single liability (a house) that continually sinks money out of you and are able to flex it, it can generate a reasonable and steady income in the range of 50-60k a year without too much difficulty.

Owning a boat isn't practical at lower income levels unless you are going to be constantly using it, and are aware of what the costs of maintenance are - just like owning a car: Owning a boat is a vehicle that comes with maintenance (hull, motor, etc) and if neglected - when it breaks, it will cost you an arm and a leg, but if you maintain it - shy of crashing, it should be fine. Of course - just like cars, boats have good manufacturers and shoddy ones that are done on the cheap, and just like cars: you get what you pay for (at least, to a point).",h8arw3i,t3_p0zg2e,1628524721,1628549921.0,/r/ontario/comments/p0zg2e/the_carrot_on_the_stick_is_gone/h8arw3i/,2021-08-09 15:58:41,2021-08
1258,Okami-Alpha,ontario,"This is not happening just to Ontario, but in many places worth living.

At the risk of this sounding like an ""I told you so"" post, I'll continue for the sake of discussion; this all started with the disconnect between the boomer generation and late genX/Y with regards to going to University. 

In their time, someone with a BA could simply walk into pretty much any decent job, whether their degre trained them for it or not. One example I could give was an old research technician I knew in my undergrad who had a BA but was working in a science lab. 

Those days of just getting any old degree and laughing away to a cushy job have been long gone for at &gt;20 years. Unfortunately, getting a liberal arts degree makes it even tougher. You need to plan ahead and get a degree that is specialized in an industry of 'need'. I worked in a bus factory during my summers in undergrad and lost count of the number of full timers there that would make fun of the university students saying that we'd all be back there looking for jobs when we got our degree. While that happened for some, I vowed it was not going to happen to me. I decided to specialize in sciences, got an HonBsc, then a PhD and left the country to do a post-doc in California. For those that do not know, living on grad student salary in Toronto is very difficult. Living on a post-doc salary in the bay area (with a kid) is also very difficult, but the idea was to make the sacrifices when I was young and more resilient. It was the best decision on which my (working class) boomer parents could never have advised me. 

I had every intention of returning to Ontario (or elsewhere in Canada), but decided to stay due to there being more jobs in California than anywhere in Canada. I often asked the same question, "" should I have just gotten a masters and gotten a job earlier in life so I could start saving for a home/retirement in my 20s instead of my 40s?"" Well, I learned that even with specializing in my undergrad, if I didn't get a PhD, my title and salary would be capped with few opportunities to break through those barriers, despite being able get into the housing market at a time when it was a little more reasonable. In the end, it was a better decision to stick with it. I am doing very well now, but the point I wanted to make was that I made sacrifices for nearly 20 years!!!! to get my degree and start doing well. I had to leave all family support behind in Canada and start a new life in another country, which offers much less social support than Canada. 

I guess what I am trying to say is, I wouldn't keep second guessing your choices, assuming things would've been better if you made them sooner. Your parents (just like mine) had a different view on life growing up and didn't know any better. Unfortunately they didn't advise you better with regards to your degree choice. I hope I am in a better position to advise my child, but you never know how the world will change. 

Nobody can predict what will happen in the housing market and I am sure you will have another crack at it. Just do what you can to prepare for it if it comes. 

Keep in mind that those that are doing well, in many cases, had to make sacrifices to get to where they were. For me it was living on a tight budget with no savings for about 20 yrs. Happiness and job satisfaction are not all solved with a good cheque. At some point it becomes relative. I constantly feel like my peers are smarter than me and are going places in their career while I'm lagging behind. An objective 3rd party look at my scenario and say I am crazy to think that, but I still fight with those notions. As I am trying to get contractors to renovate my house, I am questioning myself of whether these changes to my home will make me any happier than I am now. 

Try and look at the positives. Right now trades and construction are booming to say the least. The pandemic could've dealt you a worse hand. We also have no idea what longer term effects the pandemic will have on life as we know it. 

Try to look ahead for opportunities and try to take advantage of needs. Keep your eyes and ears open for those 'ins' that could get you back on the track you want to be on. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I want to say that life takes a toll on a lot of us and mental health is an issue that transcends degree, wages and cost of living.

Both my parents (working in different companies) for over 30 yrs had no choice multiple times to take pay and benefit cuts to keep their jobs in the 80s and 90s.

With the cost of inflation by the time they reached retirement, they were making less than when they started. Both of them had no choice but to work well after retirement age to make up for those losses. 

Executives on the other hand are making 400x more than they did in the late 70s.

My husband has had the same happen in the last 10 years. Worked hard, top producer, a new company comes in and threatens everyone with moving to a cheaper country if wages are not reduced.

Executives earned bonuses and top salaries for keeping costs down at the expense of the workers. 

This is happening everywhere. When times are bad the workers suffer. When times are good executives get a windfall. Workers' lives never get better.

For 4 decades this has been allowed to continue in Canada with no end in sight.

1283,Hypno-phile,PEI,"&gt;Lobby , be vocal and concise. At any opportunity pressure to have the 15, yes fifteen open yet not posted nurse practicioner positions filled and expanded to 750.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There is absolutely zero reasons why  taxpayers should have to spend $39 to a doctor to have an appointment to refill a prescription someone has been on for a decade.

True, but the taxpayer also gets an incredible bargain when they pay the same $39 for a much longer more complex visit.


&gt;There is absolutely zero reason why a doctor salaried at $160/hr shoukd be allowed to get away with doing bare minimum at their practice then walking downstairs at 530 and banging through 60 people at a walkin clinic in 3 hours at $28 a piece

""Bare minimum"" is working until 5:30, then doing another 3 hours of work? And 20 patients an hour for 3 hours straight sounds like an incredibly efficient clinic with a doctor on rollerblades. Or it sounds like there's to much work for the doctor to do.

&gt;There is absolutely no reason why doctors should be getting 3 slush funds to play with that pay their malpractice insurance after the first $1500, pay for ""education"" conferences and pays "" isolation"" for setting up outside ctown/summerside.

Those aren't ""slush funds."" They're compensation in lieu of higher pay. Pretty much every province has negotiated similar finding. Remember in general doctors are not paid benefits such as sick pay, vacation pay, medical benefits, disability insurance, or retirement/pension funding. They aren't usually eligible for workers compensation. 

I *really* have to take issue with your comment on ""educational"" conferences. Medicine is constantly evolving and there's a tremendous amount of ongoing professional development to keep up with. Doing ongoing training is considered a professional responsibility and often a condition of maintaining a medical license. 

Those classes aren't cheap! To attend a point-of-care ultrasound certification bootcamp costs &gt;$5000, takes 3 days, and involves 10h+ of pre-class study. So 2h a night of work for a week when you could be working earning money, or spending time with your family, or sleeping. Then 3 days of in person learning (likely closing your office for at least one day). That assumes the course is happening in your community of course-more likely you may have to travel so let's add on several days accommodation and travel costs, plus extra time off work to allow for travel time.

BTW, having this training helps you take care of patients, but does*not* allow you to make more money-there are no billing codes available to pay you for doing a point of care ultrasound assessment of your patient. Do I know doctors who still think it's important that they gain this skill and pursue this training? Oh my, yes.

On the smaller scale, many doctors working in hospitals are required to maintain Advanced Cardiac Life Support certification in an ongoing basis. This course is a lot cheaper, but a recertification course still takes all day. And to take it you have to do a Basic Life Certification course which is kind of BS but Heart and Stroke makes it a requirement. So quite potentially that's two days of attending classes on your own dime-the hospital isn't paying, and you're not making any money while you're there (also yet again missing your kid's hockey game or piano recital etc).

Not sure how much CME funding PEI doctors can get, but in most provinces it's about $2000-$2500/yr. It helps defray *some* of these costs, but you're still spending money to do this stuff.

The alternative is to pay a ton more, of course.

&gt;I think fully 80% of all GP visits could be accomplished by  NP. 1 doctor per 4 nurse practicioners working out of a clinic could do a lot to cut wait times, should be set up like that 24/7 at the hospitals. Not bleeding on floor, see NP first to get penicillin for that strep.

Old GPs will say ""half of what I do could be done just as well by a skilled nurse. Trouble is I still have no idea which half."" Realistically, there aren't NPs around to fill these roles anyway, and they're not much cheaper than doctors once you factor in non-salary benefits. I agree we could use more of them and make much better use of them than we do. Though honestly I think it would be easier to use NPs as specialist extenders rather than as family doctor extenders.",h7oj8rn,t3_ox50ic,1628087356,1628112556.0,/r/PEI/comments/ox50ic/is_there_anything_i_can_do_about_emergency_wait/h7oj8rn/,2021-08-04 14:29:16,2021-08

Disclaimer: this is an opinion piece. I’m not familiar too much with health care political issues too much. Please inform me; if I’m wrong on certain aspect. 

So, currently working in hospital and I can see doctors, nurses, porters, screeners, and other staff members simply get burned out. What I’ve seen is some people don’t follow the rules in hospital and act as they can say or do anything to the health care workers. 

Regarding OP: my personal opinion is that a raise is needed in the health care sectors, but it has to be reasonable. What we need is another incentive rather than just the wage for nurses to come join the team. Perhaps like retirement plan or something of that sort. Just increasing just the wages on nursing won’t solve the issues. A serious and careful investment should be taken on equipments that nurses use and getting right tools. 

Now, I do indeed believe we should investment more towards health care sectors. But, the core problems seems the upper management along with cuts. There should be investment towards nursing, management, and other places within the hospital to ensure the that hospital works efficiently as much possible.

WTF is the Alberta Enterprise Group?

It's a sort of union of Alberta based businesses that was founded by N. Murray Edwards. The AEG is an anti-labour organization that opposes action on climate change, taxes on the rich, and non-Conservative governments. They have taken ads out and written op-eds attacking the carbon tax, and Trudeau.

Their members include:
 
- Edmonton Oilers
- Calgary Flames
- Calgary Stampeders
- DynaLife Medical Labs
- Moodys Tax
- PCL Construction
- RBC
- Rogers
- Shane Homes
- Syncrude
- UBER
- Wellington Advocacy

It's notable here that Dynalife medical labs--a for-profit medical service company--is owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement fund. Essentially, Dynalife is owned by unions in Ontario, and is a member of an anti-union lobby group in Alberta. Yeah. wtf.

Also Wellington Advocacy deserves it's own post. That lobby group was started by ex-Kenney staffers, and is essentially a funnel that companies pour money into and Conservative policies come out the other side.

It’s a never ending cycle. They need money to dump into political campaigns. Even your local MP and MPP are fundraising and spending tens of thousands of dollars. With those donations, they make space on their platform for their biggest supporters so that they can get money for re-election. 

Outside of fundraising, the vast majority of voters are retirement age. Most of the people who take the time and go to vote in most elections are over the age of 40. That has changed SLIGHTLY in the past couple elections but not enough that politicians are going to take to Twitter and Reddit and see what their constituents are saying. They act when they feel their re-election is in jeopardy. Until then, they remain situation normal so that they can make sure fundraising dollars come in for the next election. 

What you can and should do if you feel you’re not being heard is to vote, contact your MPs and MPPs on a regular basis with concerns (even if they don’t get back to you), and if you feel super political active, register with a party so you can have some input on how represents your riding.

The struggle that I, and others, have run into is that... there really aren't that many places these days that are really *better* than Canada, without one or multiple massive drawbacks. America? I hope you have a job with kick ass health insurance, and, depending on where you live, the Cost of Living is just as bad or worse. Alternatively, I hope you have a thick skin for extremely toxic behavior of many kinds, something that drove several of my graduating class (about half of which went to the US for study or work) back up to the great white north within a few years. 

Western Europe? Lots of the same problems. Shit's insanely expensive there, and getting in can be nightmarishly difficult. Same goes for Australia, northern Europe, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand. 

And this was *before* the Coronavirus borked everything by an order of magnitude. 

So what about staying within Canada, and moving to a cheaper province?

Much more realistic, but still imperfect. Lots of houses/buildings out East or West were built a long ass time ago. They're less efficient to heat and cool, harder to repair or renovate, and you'll almost certainly need a robust vehicle, because they don't have the snow removal infrastructure we have here. It's cheaper up front, but expect to pay more in the long-term for these reasons, gradually chipping away at the appeal.

I think... the sad reality is that, unless you work in a *very* high paid technical profession, the standards our parents lived by just don't exist anymore for the majority of young people. By every metric, we work more hours, for less take-home pay, in a world where the buying power of our dollars go a lot less far, in a work environment where you have to compete with literally everyone, globally, and an aging Boomer generation expects us to pay for their retirement one way or another.

1327,PM_ME__RECIPES,ontario,"Hi, other nutrition manager here.

I've taken the program, as well as instructed in one for several years and I've done curriculum development for a portion of it, so I guess I would recommend it. I largely enjoyed the program, there were some parts I found a bit dry, but that's the nature of an academic program.

Demand varies, there are a lot of LTC homes, retirement homes, and hospitals in and around Toronto, but it can still be competitive to find work. Most starting positions are likely going to be part-time, but I've had some students land full-time work pretty quickly after graduation as well. There are also some options outside of healthcare where a FNM diploma can come in handy - I've had students who ended up doing work in product development, hotels, specialized catering (Real Food For Real Kids has hired a few of my past students), food service/healthcare sales, and I got turned down once for a c-suite job at a food startup but they did interview me twice. 

Worst case if you take the program and have trouble finding work as a FNM, the diploma does qualify you too work as a dietary aide or cook in healthcare as well.

Salary varies, I'm full-time in a mid-sized non-profit home, and I make about 70k/year + middling benefitsfrom that. Smaller homes &amp; for-profit homes of similar size tend to pay less, in a municipal home I would make a decent bit more and have better benefits. A man can dream.

Sure you could start a business, though I would be careful depending on what business you want to start, and make sure you're not going outside a nutrition manager's scope of practice. And if you want to consult, get some experience working and managing first.

Ease of getting a job varies - but I know that when I've had placement students from FNM programs who really impressed me I've either hired them myself (when possible) or made a serious effort to connect them with people who can cast a wider net to find them a job (food service company reps are great for this, they talk to everyone). Generally most of my more motivated students find work pretty quickly, but some people do struggle.

Volunteering is great, though it may be difficult under current circumstances and not all facilities take volunteers in food service (it's extra work for us too even though the extra hands can be nice). I would say better to try and work p/t through school or focus as much as possible on your studies and either way really kill it in your externship placement.

You mean you guys don't debrief ... and utilize your EFAP ...? Hah. /s. Of course. I used our EFAP ONCE ... never again. I'd rather eat the cost myself or ... just not bother.

No arguement there. But we were doing it anyway ... We trained brand spanking new med/surg nurses to work w/ ICU nurses.

1351,Extreme_Ideal7949,PEI,"I've been saying this all along, and it's a super unpopular opinion, but its not the job of landlords to provide low income housing. Government LOVES that landlords are taking all this heat because it's taking the heat off them. Landlords are in the business of making money, they're not the providers of social nets. 

Sure, some landlords are scumbags - PEI established that fact over 250 years ago when the Island was split into 67 lots and handed out to King George's friends. But for every slumlords, there's a dozen or more decent business people who are just trying to work toward a retirement like everyone else.

I worked for a great landlord several years ago. The guy did whatever he could to ensure his tenants had what they needed. Sadly his tenants basically ripped the shirt off his back. This one beast kept giving him shit because her toilet wouldn't always flush right - that's fair, toilets need to flush. A couple quick fixes didn't seem to get the job done, so eventually a plumber had to come in and run a camera in the line. They were thinking maybe a tree root was clogging the pipe outside. Guess what they found? A hair brush belonging to the same tenant. ""Haven't seen that in a while - haha"". She could have said something months sooner and saved the guy nearly $5,000 - but she played stupid. She eventually moved out and even got her damage deposit back. 

Anyway, landlords absolutely need their own association. Their businesses, investments, and livelihoods are constantly under public attack. Politicians are always looking for someone to throw under a bus, and who better than a landlord on PEI?

Government created this problem by artificially pumping an economy that was only stable while it was sleeping. ""We're on a tear,"" is how Wade MacLauchlan described it. We're on a tear alright... We have people sleeping on the streets, and for whatever reason, people are blaming landlords. Get on your MLA and MP's case - it's their fucking job to build and maintain social programs, which includes housing.

1358,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt;The Star also reports that “Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) — including $4.29 million in ‘deferred trust units’ (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement).” According to the article, Chartwell’s communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it’s ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell’s corporate boardroom while front-line workers in homes are paid “abysmal, poverty wages.”

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors’ homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

I really don't understand how people can be against subsidized child care. Yes, it's costly in the immediate term, but the government gets to reap the rewards of 20-30 years worth of extra income tax that they may never have received otherwise.

1378,Marksideofthedoon,alberta,"Allow me to expand upon my earlier comment by answering some of these questions.  


1. No, I'm not saving for retirement but that has nothing to do with raising a family so it's a moot point within context of this discussion. Not everyone goes to college either, again...not a condition of raising a family. As I don't use credit, I have zero debts. Can I save for a home? Why in the world would I want to? My house wouldn't even be half paid off by the time a new born was ready to leave the nest. Housing is beyond insanely priced and anyone who buys one right now is, in my opinion, a colossal idiot.  

2. Are we eating real food? Damn straight we are! What's your definition of ""real""? Are we taking vacations? Fuck no. Vacations are useless to me.   
Wastes of money, wastes of time. I have better shit to do than sit around doing nothing. Vacations are pointless if you know how to manage your life. (and no, that statement isn't driven by a need to work those hours)  

3. I DO live that lifestyle and I don't do too poorly at it, all things considered.  
My daughter is happy and healthy and no one in this household is malnourished or wearing tattered clothing.   


So maybe take a step back and check yourself for a second.   
You've moved the goalposts considerably and several times.   
Your idea of living is not the only way to do things. Your standard for living is not the only standard that can build a happy family.  
To even suggest so means you're somehow able to ignore every single family that lives under the poverty line.

Alberta is a great place if you’re young, want to rent for a while to save up a down payment, and have the mobility to move somewhere actually decent when it’s time to buy. It is a moronic place to bet your retirement, unless you’re comfortable being underwater for possibly your entire mortgage amortization and have significant disposable income to focus on other savings as your house is unlikely to break even in 30 years when retirement comes.

This saves a lot of money by shifting the formerly-social burden of providing for retirement to the private sector. At the same time, it is supremely ironic that younger workers are being priced out of economies where they would be very valuable taxpayers during the most fruitful years of their lives, robbing the government of *that* income.

Its worked out for those people as a byproduct of happenstance after those people didn't save enough for retirement outside their house, but retirement funds is what personal saving, CPP, OAS and GIS are for. Housing as a retirement scheme is a pyramid scheme because it benefits those who got in early and leaves those in late to hold the bag. Above inflation increases in prices of essential to life goods never work out in the long run, because there is by definition no way for affordability to keep up.

To put it another way. If houses are ""naturally"" for peoples retirement savings and people arent/shouldn't be able to save otherwise, is it ""natural"" that more young people today then the last few generations won't be able to retire because they were never able to save, nor buy a house, because rent sucks up all their income that someone in their same job 30 years ago would have been able to save because rent (or mortgage payments) were a much lower % of their income? That there only hope is that they have parents who have money left over when they die and they get a big enough share soon enough to retire?

We're now 6 years into our house, we make about $350K/year.  We've accelerated our mortgage and at the current rate will be paid off in 15 years, but likely sooner as we can afford to bump our mortgage by 20% again. We just spent $110K on some renovations, and we still have $120K in non-retirement savings. We're in our late thirties. 

What I'm saying is that, for many people, your income today is not your income in a couple of years. Even inflationary increases in your salary will contribute to your ability to pay your mortgage more comfortably. When we bought, we spent less than we were approved for, and were smart about the finances, however it's obviously much more comfortable to pay our bills today than it was when we first bought. 

People shouldn't' spend too much/overreach, but it will never be ""comfortable"" getting into the place you want. If the numbers work today, in all likelihood they will work better tomorrow. And if it doesn't, you can still exit with some equity intact.

Your humble brag is nauseating (in fact it belongs on /r/iamverysmart, and your plug about working out? How the heck is that relevant lmao), but I'll reply to it for the sake of discussion: members of the lower class have no assets to invest in financial markets regardless of what knowledge they have of upcoming trends and tendencies. They live in debt, worrying about which bill is most urgent to pay. That you don't know this makes me think you weren't anywhere near the lower middle / upper lower class as you claim. And even if you were at the bottom of the pyramid and clawed your way out, you describe yourself as exceptional and admittedly (not admittingly btw) not everyone is as amazing as you. Can't you agree we should make it easier to climb out? Or even better, not have a lower class at all within Canada?

Regarding OSAP, I would advise most people to explore another avenue rather than take on debt to earn a post secondary education that still won't guarantee you a living wage.

Note: If you appreciate this, do not gild me or this throwaway account. Just be good to each other. Also this had to still be split in two. No idea how the original poster got past the 10k character limit.

&gt;Recently saw Toronto Star article on executive bonuses at Toronto Hydro and wanted to provide an insider's view ([The city has been trying to rein in executive bonuses at Toronto Hydro. Last year the CEO took home a bonus of more than $640,000 | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/business/2021/07/03/the-city-has-been-trying-to-rein-in-executive-bonuses-at-toronto-hydro-last-year-the-ceo-took-home-a-bonus-of-more-than-640000.html)). The following points are mine alone and do not represent the views of the union or the company. While this is specific for Toronto Hydro, this could also be the case for any municipality in Ontario.
&gt;
&gt;First, let's start off with how electricity works in Ontario. About 50% of electricity consumed in Ontario is generated by Ontario Power Generation, a provincial crown corporation, at their nuclear, hydroelectric (the OG power source), gas, wind, and solar plants. The electricity is stepped up to extremely high voltages and transmitted (think of the huge transmission towers along the Finch Hydro Corridor) over long distances by Hydro One, a former provincial crown corporation that has since been sold off by the Wynne government - the province owns about 50% of the company. Two other crown agencies that have a role in electricity include the Independent Electricity System Operator (who dispatches/shuts down generation plants to match consumer demand and cross border electricity import/exports), and the Ontario Energy Board (who sets the rates each company is allowed to charge the consumer). All these four companies were formally part of Ontario Hydro, until it was broken up by the Harris government. Now you have 4x the amount of executives - but all for efficiency right? Currently BC and Quebec still maintain a single generation, transmission, and distribution crown corporation, and enjoy one of the lowest electrical bills in the world.
&gt;
&gt;Toronto Hydro is a municipally owned electrical distributor. We take the high voltage power transmitted by Hydro One, step it down at one of the many substations, and then distribute it along the streets on overhead or underground electrical cables. There are further transformers along poles, streets, and underground vaults which further step down the voltage before bringing it inside your home. A lot of the electrical infrastructure in Toronto is extremely old, some of which are from the early 1950s. As you can imagine, old transformers leak and rust, cables break down, poles rot, and underground vaults flood. It's extremely costly to overhaul these equipment, but it is absolutely necessary as they reach or extend past their end-of-life.
&gt;
&gt;Here's where we transition to the current CEO, Anthony Haines. I can confidently say he is not well respected and disliked across the board by union members and management alike. Here's only some of the red flags that come up:
&gt;
&gt;- He was hired as the CEO of Hydro Ottawa and fired after only about a year. Prior to this he has had no experience working for public utilities. He then was hired by Toronto Hydro and soon became the CEO.
&gt;
&gt;- He keeps talking about the need for executive pay to be high to attract talent, but like many of you said, Toronto Hydro holds a monopoly. The company runs itself. For the better half of a century, the helm of Toronto Hydro was simply a general manager who worked their way up from the bottom, and reported to the commissioners appointed by the city.
&gt;
&gt;- He has no degree or the qualifications to lead and has repeatedly lied about it during his filings for rate increases with the Ontario Energy Board ([Toronto Hydro CEO ‘deeply sorry’ for credentials confusion | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/09/13/toronto_hydro_ceo_deeply_sorry_for_credentials_confusion.html)). The only reason he's still the CEO of Toronto Hydro since 2009 is because he is unable to get a similarly paid job elsewhere, so he's milking the rate payer as much as he can. When Ford replaced the CEO of Hydro One for excessive compensation, Haines was Ford's number one choice for replacement ([Doug Ford used legislative threat to oust Hydro One CEO, board - The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-doug-ford-used-legislative-threat-to-oust-hydro-one-ceo-board/)). Luckily for the province, that didn't happen, but unluckily for the citizens of Toronto, we're stuck with the trash. UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION HAINES HAS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH INFLUENCES DESPITE BEING COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED.
&gt;
&gt;- Many of his ""innovative"" ideas, have been costly pet projects that have been complete failures and subsequently cancelled ([Toronto Hydro and Hydrostor Inc. come together to launch the world's first underwater energy storage system (newswire.ca)](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/toronto-hydro-and-hydrostor-inc-come-together-to-launch-the-worlds-first-underwater-energy-storage-system-551383041.html), [Toronto Hydro, Ryerson launch pilot project to store energy in pole-mounted compact box | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/06/21/toronto-hydro-ryerson-launch-pilot-project-to-store-energy-in-pole-mounted-compact-box.html)). You don't need an engineering degree to know compressing air under Lake Ontario, and mounting tiny batteries on the TOP of poles are terrible solutions for energy storage. Millions were spent, all going to private companies. I won't delve into speculation beyond that.
&gt;
&gt;- He has tried to privatize Toronto Hydro ([Toronto Hydro privatization information can stay secret, watchdog rules | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2018/05/25/toronto-hydro-privatization-information-can-stay-secret-watchdog-rules.html)). While saying it's to drive innovation, he's really looking to break free from constraints set by the city. With a private company, he can obtain additional compensation in terms of stocks and even bigger bonuses to match total compensation of private energy CEOs in the US. Just look to Texas to see how great privatization has worked for them. BC Hydro went through 40 degree plus weather for half a week with no blackouts or outages. Thankfully, the plan was scrapped - for now. He's paid more than the CEO of Hydro One, and around the same as the CEO of Ontario Power Generation - who oversees two nuclear power plants, and some of the largest hydroelectric power plants in Canada.
&gt;
&gt;- He determined his defined-benefit pension plan, OMERS, wasn't being fair to him because it only took into consideration his base and not his bonus pay, despite this being the standard for all public servants. He's expected to obtain $360k/year from OMERS once he retires. Since he thought that's not enough, he sued OMERS to try and include his bonus pay into his pensionable earnings (which would double his pension to $720k/year after retirement). We're funding his lawsuit and pension ([Toronto Hydro seeks bigger pensions for bosses | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/business/2011/03/01/toronto_hydro_seeks_bigger_pensions_for_bosses.html)). He lost the lawsuit, but got the Board of Directors to approve a personal, separate pension, now valued at over $1.5 million dollars ([Toronto Hydro CEO gets pension top-up of up to $1.65 million | The Star](https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/04/02/toronto_hydro_ceo_gets_pension_topup_of_up_to_165_million.html)). If you read the article, the chairman who approved the additional pension, now has the newest substation named another her ([Copeland Station - Toronto Hydro](https://www.torontohydro.com/improving-reliability/copeland-station)). Usually substations are named after their location - Copeland Station was originally scheduled to be named Bremner Station. A rate payer funded branding of a substation for $1.5 million dollars.
&gt;
&gt;- He has largely contracted out most internal jobs through attrition and retirement. Almost all capital projects, which involved the replacement of old transformers, cables, etc. and trouble trucks who respond to outages are done by large third party contractors. Part of his bonus is determined by the amount of capital work that is done. $4 billion dollars of capital work, paid through rate increases to the rate payers, is scheduled to be done over the next four years ([Toronto Hydro receives decision from the Ontario Energy Board for 2020-2024 electricity distribution rates application (newswire.ca)](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/toronto-hydro-receives-decision-from-the-ontario-energy-board-for-2020-2024-electricity-distribution-rates-application-895534592.html)). You can bet he gets a kickback from giving the large contracts to his buddies' companies. Work done by these external companies are rushed and often brand new transformers costing hundred of thousands of dollars fail within a new months. This is perfect for Haines and his bonus since more capital work = bigger bonus.
&gt;
&gt;So, at the end of the day, Haines has turned the largest municipally owned electrical distribution company in Canada into his personal company to pad his pay check and pension. Despite holding a monopoly on electricity distribution, we don't have enough internal crews to respond to power out calls or replace our own infrastructure. Toronto Hydro is slowly turning into a management company, dishing out contracts to private companies from our pockets. Hydroelectric power was created (by Sir Adam Beck, a conservative no less) to provide affordable electricity to the citizens of Ontario.

1489,kindesflaye,ontario,"The paragraph after this is a response to your first point; the second paragraph is a bit of morale pep talk. Just so you know.

1) The money your company makes off your labor doesn't just pay your wages. It pays the payroll taxes your company pays on your behalf; it pays for your health insurance and retirement benefits; it pays some of the overhead that goes to paying other administrative type employees whose labor doesn't contribute directly to the company profits. It pays property taxes and electrical bills, etc. It's easy to hate on your employer / landlord but there's a lot you don't see. I rented my home out for a single year when I was away on a work assignment and it was freaking sketchy. I have a lot more appreciation for landlords now.

2) Homes are really overpriced now and it's a complicated issue -- keep doing your best to keep saving, and always focus on living well within your means. It may seem hopeless but you'd be surprised just how much progress you can make over years of living frugally with a concrete financial / economic goal. Good luck.

They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain’t in it. You and I are not in the big club.

All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it’s ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell’s corporate boardroom while front-line workers in homes are paid “abysmal, poverty wages.”

So UCP moves pensions to APP, and as a pre-election bonus reduces the contribution rate because ‘we’re no longer funding the other provinces’.

1558,DAHosting,alberta,"**Why leaving Canada makes sense for Alberta, and U.S. would likely welcome a new state**

U.S. forecaster Peter Zeihan, a former geopolitical analyst with the security firm Stratfor, has spent his career trying to predict the future of tumultuous states — recently, he’s turned his gaze to North America. Now, his latest book, The Accidental Superpower, takes a bleak look at the direction of the world in general. Among his speculations, the future of Alberta in Canada. He spoke to the Post‘s Jen Gerson.

**Q** Tell me about your book as a whole?

**A** The global system as we understand it is highly artificial. The United States created it after the Second World War to fight the Cold War. We introduced this concept of free trade that allowed anyone we were friendly with to trade with anyone else we were friendly with — the U.S. guaranteed the security of the oceans, it would open its markets, it would patrol the Middle East and make sure energy could get to where it needed to go. Before, you had competing empires fighting for resources and markets. The American system expanded peace and prosperity throughout the world in a way the human race had never experienced before. But we did it to contain the Soviet Union. Since the Cold War ended, the U.S. has been withdrawing from that system.

**Q** Why?

**A** Two big things. The first is shale oil — the U.S. will be energy independent by the end of 2016. Shale is severing the strongest link between us in North America and the rest of the world. The Middle East is becoming someone else’s problem.

The second piece is demographics. The percentage of Americans who are baby boomers is smaller than the equivalent cohort elsewhere. Every other country (except New Zealand) has a much larger population hitting mass retirement, and you’ve got all the financial problems that come with that.

**Q** Amid this interesting geopolitical shift, you devote a chapter to Alberta’s possible secession.

**A** Canada’s demographic situation is similar to the rest of the developed world — a large population moving toward retirement and hardly any young people in the replacement generation coming up.

However, Alberta does not fit that mould. It is the youngest province, and is becoming younger, better paid and more highly skilled as the rest of Canada becomes older and less skilled, and a ward of the state financially.

The other piece is, of course, energy. British Columbia has been hostile to Alberta’s efforts to diversity oil exports and the Atlantic is more than 2,000 miles away.

But really, it comes down to demographics. Right now, every man, woman and child in Alberta pay $6,000 more into the national budget than they get back. Alberta is the only province that is a net contributor to that budget — by 2020, the number will exceed $20,000 per person, $40,000 per taxpayer. That will be the greatest wealth transfer in per capita terms in the Western world. The only other place we see things like that is in Saudi Arabia, where the oil-producing regions subsidize the rest of the country.

**Q** Secession has been a dirty political word in Alberta for several years, with politicians rumoured to be secret secessionists. That talk died down when the Harper Conservatives were elected — when a group of people who came out of the Alberta mould assumed power.

**A** On Stephen Harper’s watch, Alberta’s tax bill has basically tripled. This is going on while you have a federal government that is pro-Alberta.

From my point of view, it doesn’t matter if it’s this government, the next government, or the one after. The demographic trends are locked in. If you get a government in Ottawa that isn’t Conservative, isn’t born, bred, raised and trained in Alberta, what do you think they’re going to be doing to the tax policies?

**Q** So this is a conversation about secession to the U.S.?

**A** Alberta as an independent country doesn’t solve a huge number of problems. If it left Canada, its currency goes through the roof because all it has is oil exports, and that would drive agriculture out of business. It would be a one-horse economy in a very short time.

Seceding to the U.S. becomes the only political and economic option. If you do that, the inflation issue goes away, the tax problem goes away, the security problem goes away. Alberta gets everything it says it wants out of Canada within the first year of joining the U.S.

Seceding to the U.S. becomes the only political and economic option

**Q** Do you think the Americans would have us?

**A** Americans have a reputation for being ignorant and short-sighted, but I would be stunned if there was a single person in Congress who would think this a bad idea. If you bring Alberta into the country, the U.S. becomes technically energy independent overnight. I would expect ratification of the expansion to sail through Congress in a matter of hours.

**Q** In Alberta, the numbers and logic might make sense, but politically and culturally it still seems to be a huge stretch to think Albertans would seriously consider this.

**A** I’m a forecaster. My job is to look at the trends of how the world works. Comfort makes people a little more passive and Canada is a comfortable place. Because secession is legal, Albertans are going to have to think about this — that doesn’t mean they will seriously consider it. But a $40,000 per taxpayer bill every year, that’s a bit of a motivator.

1582,workerbotsuperhero,ontario,"&gt;The Star also reports that “Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) — including $4.29 million in ‘deferred trust units’ (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement).” According to the article, Chartwell’s communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

People also can test falsely positive after already having had an active infection, and a few have had false positives after being vaccinated. All healthcare workers regardless of the setting are supposed to be self-screening and reporting their results to their employer daily. Anyone with symptoms is instructed to self-isolate and test.

LTCs have much fewer staff members and they happen to work with the most vulnerable populations for the disease. So, protecting those in LTCs keeps more of them out of the hospital. Theoretically, at least.

My parents have mentioned a few times that they wished they could have done that along with start putting money away for retirement when my brother and I were born (they in mid late 20s). But even with a two parent income, it wasn't possible to do much more than a few thousand for tuition for me. Yeah after inflation, our house cost them under $220k. But with our house going for over 800k now? Impossible. At least in our city.

It's wonderful to save up money to benefit your kids and do so if you can, but at the same time, a home ≠ happiness. Living within your means is much more valuable. And the (very American) belief that to grow up is to move away from your family is low-key really toxic and detrimental depending where you live and the circumstances.

In addition. People also assume an adult child living with their parents means they're mooching of them and that is rarely the case. It's actually eased both my parents and I when Mom said they don't want to force me out if it means I'll be living unsustainably and with me adding to the income and helping around as they get older, my parents no longer have to worry about the fact if one of them dies, they won't be able to keep the house. As they get older, I help around more with housework, yardwork, renos, etc. 

Lol sorry this was long. I totally understand your sentiment and again, if you can save up money for your kid, do so. At the same time, things change like housing, price of living, and sustainability. Happiness, health, and comfort are more important than just having a home and from your post, I can see you value that for them either way. Again everyone's family circumstances are different.

1661,MinchinWeb,alberta,"Just a reminder of what happened last time they touched the electricity market:

- **$2 billion** spent on early retirement of the Coal PPA (Power Purchase Agreements). They were contracts that they seemingly hadn't read before they tried to unilaterally change them, and then they misrepresented the contracts so badly afterwards they (the NDP) were [sued for defamation](https://financialpost.com/news/hemstock-files-new-affidavit-in-electricity-fight-with-government) by the lawyer who helped to negotiate the PPA contracts.
- **$1 billion** committed to the RRO price cap. Seeing as the early retirement of the coal PPAs had basically tripled wholesale electricity prices overnight, this served as a way to hide from Albertans the change in prices. It also had the deliberate effect of excluding all competitive retailers from the program.
- whatever extra you're currently paying on your power bill...

If the NDP gets a hold of the electricity market again, I would expect:

- only those ""blessed"" by the government building power plants. Others may officially be allowed to build power plants, but without the government's capacity and/or green subsidies, it will be impossible to compete.
- only the ""blessed"" and subsidized, government approved RRO will remain for you to buy power from. All competitive players will be forced out of the market because they can't compete against a government subsidy that is multiples of their gross margins.
- unsubsidized power prices to at least double (to ~15 cents/kWh + transmission and distribution) what they were when the RRO price cap came in.
- you'll see another two monopolies solidified (power generation and power retailing) in Alberta.
- combined with the carbon tax hikes, you'll see ""energy poverty"" start becoming a thing",h0ncgxl,t3_nsjy9e,1622864073,1622889273.0,/r/alberta/comments/nsjy9e/notley_pledges_netzero_electricity_grid_by_2035/h0ncgxl/,2021-06-05 03:34:33,2021-06

I feel you.  My doctor retired 2yrs ago now,  Still don't have a replacement even though I personally know nearly half the doctors in town.  

That said, in the US they have just as much of a challenge getting doctors if you aren't wealthy or aren't in a major city.  Doctors go where the money is in the US,  and to a lesser degree here.      I don't want a US style system,  but I do want a WAY MORE favourable compensation system for family doctors to set up Family health teams ( or equivalents) outside of the major urban centres 

My Doctor moved to my area some 40ish years ago because they did a 1yr tax deferral for doctors back then if they went rural, so the first year their earnings were tax free and every year after they paid taxes on the year before, ( so at retirement he paid a double tax of his last year of work and first year in retirement).

1684,CanadianHerpNurse,ontario,"Oh please. Spare me the undeserved condescension. Don't talk to me about assumptions and lack of experience when you don't know the first thing about me. It's not my fault that you've disregarded and conveniently omitted a response to the multitude of perfectly valid points that I have raised thus far. Furthermore, you DO know that the oldest members of Gen Z are 24, yes? As in, every single ""point"" you've broached can also apply to myself and many of my peers? You talk about anecdotes and not being able to see beyond my bubble, but the running theme of your responses have been ""me, me, me"". So which is it? You seem to have a good deal of insight into the upcoming struggles of Gen Z, but I can't help but notice that your arguments don't reflect reality in the slightest. Firstly, don't make me laugh by mentioning my ""privilege"". Nothing suggests a departure from reality more than commenting on another's current status without having even a shred of insight into how they got there or where they came from. I don't \*have\* any privilege. My circumstances are the result of my own hard work and the choices that I have made. Choices, by the way, that are not exclusive to myself in any capacity. Nothing that I have done has been ""special"" or ""unusual"". As I have already mentioned, if you choose to pursue a higher education you need to be aware of your earning potential and job prospects. This can easily be done in an afternoon. You have also completely misrepresented the amount of Canadians with higher education. You said that it is not possible for many, and a privilege for most. This is entirely false.  63% of Canadians between the ages of 25 and 34 had tertiary education as of 2019. How could this possibly be considered a privilege when nearly three-quarters of the population possesses it? Furthermore, again, you have completely neglected to address my comments regarding the military avenue. You clearly misunderstood, so allow me to reiterate my point. The military is incredibly inclusive and is accessible to the overwhelming majority of the population. If you do not have the financial or familial backing to attend university, this is an excellent option for you. They will sponsor your education in many STEM fields, social sciences, and outlying fields of study. You are provided with appropriate pay, insanely affordable housing, better benefits than most of the country has access to, as well as realistic career progression. You do not even need to attend university or college through the military in order to be successful therein. I do not think that you are even interested in providing solutions to the issues posed by the original poster. You mention that ""not everybody wants to move"" as though that's an argument that holds water, somehow? You said that not everybody wants to ""chase money and opportunity"".. literally on the coattails of your prior statement regarding how financially damaging university can be..and I don't even know how that is a coherent, adult response to anything? So, by your own logic, it's an appropriate life strategy to invest in a higher education, which suggests ambition and drive for some form of success, but then to not pursue any of the opportunities that might present in life? No wonder you were abysmally below average in regards to salary. I'm sorry, but people have known for the last thirty years that the GTA is insanely unaffordable for most people in regards to purchasing property. This holds true for innumerable cities alllll over the world..so if you would like to speak about this honestly, lets try and have some intellectual integrity, yes? I would not pursue a career in nursing in the GTA, ever. I make substantially more than the average person, and even still I would never attempt this. Why? Well, the answer is simple: I know that the career I chose does not support a lifestyle that would allow me to be financially successful to the degree that I want within the GTA. I really cannot wrap my brain around how you think it's an even remotely acceptable response to say ""well some people don't want to move or chase jobs, it's not their fault that the housing market is garbage so they should remain stagnant and complain on reddit all day lololol"". How about we encourage some accountability and emphasize taking charge of your life, yeah? Of course it sucks that many people can't live in the same towns that they grew up in, of course. Nobody is suggesting otherwise. However, to suggest that people just stay there and rail against a system that they are largely powerless to effectively change, what is the use? See, I think the real issue of this scenario isn't that \*I\* am incapable of grasping the situation faced by Gen z, no; I think the issue is that you, and many people like you, have been unable to adapt to the societal changes that have been evolving for the last few decades. You would rather bemoan your circumstances than be proactive. You lump everybody else in with you, too, so you feel comfortable with the false knowledge of ""it's not just me"". If you choose to remain in a geographical area that prevents you from being financially successful, and you have the means and opportunity to move, anything that happens as a result of your staticity is entirely your fault. Your situation in the GTA was entirely your own fault, and I think your inability to see that is quite telling. You chose a relatively common profession with fixed, long-term positions in the largest urban centre in Canada, and then you speak to me as though this wasn't the result of your own choices? Maybe you shouldn't have picked a career with finite positions in one of the most densely-populated, most expensive cities in the entire country? Maybe you should have chased opportunity, or even done a single iota of research regarding what your life post-university would have been like? You have presented young people reading this thread with \*zero\* solutions to their situation. You have willfully ignored many of the helpful suggestions that I have provided, the majority of which are feasible and attainable for nearly everybody, and you have promoted blatant falsehoods. Nursing positions disappearing? My bloody eye they are. Is that why the government just invested millions of dollars into nursing programs? We literally called several hundred nurses out of retirement in Ottawa to help with immunizing the population because there were so few available. That isn't even discussing the long-term projections of nursing shortages coinciding with our aging population and the sheer volume of retiring nurses. God, even the language you use is misrepresentative. Referring to people my age who made it as ""survivors"". Please, try not to drown in your own sea of melodrama. The reality is that Gen Z has more access to information than any generation that preceded them. They have the ability to ascertain what areas of the province will be best suited to their interests, and they can make their choices from there. Is it unfair that the housing market is in such a state? Of course not. Are some degrees and career paths more financially viable than others? Obviously, but this has always been the case. Will Gen Z be forced to move and seek out opportunity in large volumes than previously seen? I would say that this is entirely likely, yes. However, this is a pendular phenomenon, too, and each generation has its tests. Does any of the above mean that generation Z is somehow ""screwed"" or been ""cheated"" out living successful and fulfilling lives? Absolutely not, and to suggest otherwise is intellectually dishonest, false, and provides nothing of value in the slightest to those reaching out for help or reading this for reassurance.",h0cbua5,t3_nog9d0,1622657541,1622682741.0,/r/ontario/comments/nog9d0/how_will_generation_z_even_live_in_ontario/h0cbua5/,2021-06-02 18:12:21,2021-06

TORONTO — As was previously announced, Ontario’s Stay-at-Home order will expire on June 2, 2021. When it does, all other public health and workplace measures will remain in place provincewide until Ontario enters Step One of the Roadmap to Reopen, at which point some restrictions will ease with an initial focus on outdoor settings.

“We’ve seen great progress in our fight against COVID-19 in recent weeks, but now is not the time to let our guard down,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. “With the Stay-At-Home order set to expire, we need to provide people with certainty so that they can continue to follow public health guidance. Doing so will help us to meet our goal of starting to gradually lift some restrictions when we enter Step One of the Roadmap when it is safe to do so.”
On April 7, 2021, in response to the rapid increase in COVID-19 transmission driven by new, more contagious variants, the Ontario government declared a provincial emergency and issued a Stay-at-Home order as well as enhanced public health measures. In a concentrated effort to reduce mobility and opportunities for transmission, the Stay-At-Home order required Ontarians to remain at home except for the purposes set out in the order, such as exercise, going to the grocery store or pharmacy, or accessing health care services. Once the Stay-at-Home order expires on June 2, these restrictions will no longer be in effect.
However, all other existing measures will remain in place provincewide, including restrictions on gatherings, businesses, services and activities. This includes limiting indoor gatherings to households only and outdoor gatherings to up to five people, subject to limited exceptions, maintaining a cap of 25 per cent capacity for essential retail where only certain goods are permitted to be sold, restricting non-essential retail to curbside pickup and delivery only, as well as limiting short-term rentals to individuals in need of housing and allowing Ontario Parks and campgrounds on public lands to be used for day-use only, subject to limited exceptions.
Ontarians will be able to leave home to travel within the province to a secondary residence for any reason, however, they are not be permitted to host members of another household indoors except for a person from another household who lives alone or a caregiver.
A simple, easy-to-understand summary of restrictions can be found on the province’s “Reopening Ontario” webpage, which provides details on what public health measures are in place before the province enters Step One of the Roadmap to Reopen. As always, anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 or who may be exhibiting symptoms of the virus should use the province’s self-assessment tool to determine what they should do next, including getting a test and isolating if necessary.
“As we continue to accelerate second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for Ontarians, maintaining public health measures will ensure we continue to protect our hospital capacity and help stop the spread of COVID-19 variants,” said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. “As we look towards Step One of Ontario’s Roadmap and begin to gradually lift public health measures, it remains critical that all Ontarians continue to follow public health advice and roll up their sleeves to receive the vaccine. Every dose administered means we are one step closer to the end of the pandemic.”
With the expiry of the Stay-at-Home order, emergency order O. Reg 266/21 (Residential Evictions) will also expire on June 2, 2021. Emergency orders currently in effect under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act have been extended until June 16, 2021:

1701,Kayge,ontario,"Wow... Just wow.  Article here, comments below:  

&gt;Premier Doug Ford is considering a major revamp of his cabinet as the one-year countdown begins to the June 2, 2022 election, the Star has learned.  

&gt;After the legislature rises Thursday for the summer, high-ranking Progressive Conservative sources say the premier will turn his eye toward a significant shuffle of ministers.  

&gt;While some advisers have suggested nearly every minister should be moved to a new portfolio — and that Ford should dump some cabinet members to bring in fresh blood — no decisions have been made.  

&gt;“There will be lots of changes this summer,” said one senior official, who, like others interviewed over several days, spoke confidentially to discuss internal deliberations.  

&gt;Another top insider suggested some veteran Tory ministers might be in for a surprise.  

&gt;“Those legacy MPPs (in cabinet) who are in safe seats, and have been anti-lockdown, were a big part of why the premier opened things too fast in February and closed things too slowly in April,” noted the second official.  

&gt;“Some of them could be shuffled out because they gave (Ford) questionable advice that was out of step with what Ontarians wanted.”  

&gt;But a third Tory said Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark, Infrastructure Minister Laurie Scott, Associate Energy Minister Bill Walker, Natural Affairs Minister John Yakabuski, and Environment Minister Jeff Yurek have all been outspoken over the impact of lockdowns on the economy and on mental health.  

&gt;The third PC adviser stressed that doesn’t necessarily mean that any of those five would be removed from cabinet, but warned some veterans in safe seats could be expected to take one for the team.  

&gt;“We’re in the seat-winning business and promoting others (in more vulnerable urban ridings to cabinet) could save their seats,” the third insider said.  

&gt;“This is about the team and (Ford) understands that.”  

&gt;Asked about concerns any scorned Tory MPPs might opt against running again next year if removed from cabinet, the official shot back, “We can find candidates to replace them (in their ridings) in 15 minutes.”  

&gt;That’s because “these are legacy seats,” that the Tories hold even when they are in opposition, the insider said.  

&gt;As part of his push for new energy in cabinet, sources say the premier also wants his executive council to be more representative of Ontario’s diversity.  

&gt;“It’s too white and too male,” a top official said firmly.  

&gt;Several insiders say Ford has been impressed by the performance of MPPs Stan Cho (Willowdale), Parm Gill (Milton), Nina Tangri (Mississauga-Streetsville), Vijay Thanigasalam (Scarborough-Rouge Park), and Effie Triantafilopoulos (Oakville North-Burlington), among others.  

&gt;“He knows there’s a lot of talent there,” said a Tory insider.  

&gt;Some junior ministers can also expect to be promoted.  

&gt;Associate Small Business Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Transportation Minister Kinga Surma, and Associate Women’s and Children’s Minister Jill Dunlop have all performed well, the insiders agreed.  

&gt;Education Minister Stephen Lecce has been angling to be moved because he’s concerned about teachers’ unions targeting his King-Vaughan riding next spring.  

&gt;(In the 1999 election won by premier Mike Harris’s Tories, PC education minister David Johnson was defeated in Don Valley East after hundreds of unionized teachers volunteered to help Liberal David Caplan.)  

&gt;Further complicating matters, the Conservatives are not yet sure if Health Minister Christine Elliott will choose to seek re-election next year in Newmarket-Aurora.  

&gt;Those two senior portfolios could be linchpins to a bigger shuffle.  

&gt;Another wild card is the return of Rod Phillips to cabinet.  

&gt;Phillips resigned as finance minister on Dec. 31 after a controversial pandemic vacation to the Caribbean island of St. Barts.  

&gt;Some around Ford insist he misses Phillips’s skills at the cabinet table and will bring him back in some role after more than five months in the penalty box.  

&gt;“I really think he wants Rod back and so do we,” said a fourth PC insider. “(Phillips is) a steadying influence who supports the premier, which is why he’s helping out on the (re-election) campaign. It’s just a matter of whether ... (the media) can get over the fact he f - - - - - up by taking a trip.”  

&gt;A cabinet shuffle would be just one aspect of Ford recasting his government.  

&gt;Two key departures are putting a new face on the public service and on the pandemic response.  

&gt;The retirement of Steven Davidson, the secretary of the cabinet, and Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, led to Ford making two major appointments in the past week.  

&gt;Well-regarded hospital president Michelle DiEmanuele will be the new head of the Ontario public service and respected Kingston-area medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore will take over as the province’s top public health official later in June.  

&gt;At the same time, Kory Teneycke, Ford’s 2018 campaign manager and a top lobbyist, is now working at Queen’s Park with the premier’s inner circle. He has taken a leave of absence from his firm, Rubicon Strategy, and is no longer lobbying.  

&gt;Teneycke is getting polling help from Nick Kouvalis, whose company, Campaign Research, is a vendor to the PC Caucus Services Bureau and to the Ontario PC Party.  

&gt;Kouvalis, who has worked with Conservative and Liberal candidates across Canada and managed the winning mayoral campaigns of John Tory and Rob Ford, has also done polls for the Star.  

&gt;He declined to comment, explaining he cannot discuss his clients.    

So let's debrief:  

1.  PCs are shuffling their cabinet because after ***36 months*** in office they figured out they don't look like the people they represent  
2.  Christine Elliott, the Minister of Health may not run - curious, wonder why.  
3.  They're going to shuffle the ridings so high ranking candidates likely to lose - because their constituents don't like them - will win.  
4.  Nick Kouvalis is back in the fray so expect more vaporware like ""SmartTrack"", Ferris Wheels and stopping ""Gravy Trains"".  

The bit that stands out most, though is bringing Rod Phillips back ""It’s just a matter of whether ... (the media) can get over the fact he f - - - - - up by taking a trip""  It's not ""the media"", it's the people of Ontario.  The people who were cancelling Christmas plans with their family while a high ranking minister hopped on a plane, then bulshitted the people of Ontario.",h06vid3,t3_npqfig,1622553930,1622579130.0,/r/ontario/comments/npqfig/stephen_lecce_said_covid19_wasnt_spreading_in/h06vid3/,2021-06-01 13:25:30,2021-06

I agree with your sentiment though, there are many towns where there is hurdles to buisness entry due to a lack of younger and educated population. The government is making strides with train transit that is putting some of the smaller towns along the corridor on the map, and many small cities right now are putting huge amounts of money into ""affordable"" market rate rentals (&lt;$1000 apartments) to attract young people to the city (who will in turn attract the jobs that actually can't work from home and eventual home buyers/builders) where historically every development was $2000+ retirement condo's.

I graduated highschool in 2003 as part of the double-cohort. That fucked shit up. I graduated university in 2008, that made it worse. I had a newly-minted masters degree but all of the jobs were being filled by people with decades of experience that had just been laid off.

After years of unemployment and short-term contract jobs, what finally got my life on track is getting a job in insurance. You get benefits, and an RRSP, and they pay for your courses. Those aren't pie-in-the-sky perks that only some places offer, either. That's the standard in the industry.

The really good places have your benefits start on your first day. And match your RRSP contributions. And pay up front for your courses instead of reimbursing you once you pass them.

I look at what my jobs were like before this, and at this taste of what all of the boomers jobs must have been like. And I'm grateful that at 30 I could have this, too. But it also pisses me off.

You'll find that the Canadian age bands are becoming similarly sized regardless of what happens with the birth rate over time.

Further, the cultures that are coming in with immigration have less of an issue using 6 incomes to buy a house and with living in close quarters if that what it takes.

In some ways that is the responsible thing to do - if not for that, supporting the boomer retirement project would have been much more difficult - but it's not a good plan to make life plans around the possible implications of changing demographics over the long term.

One thing everyone should be rejecting is more money going toward boomer causes. They have had their day and it's time to move on and give a leg up to the next generation.

1. The Canadian economy has very low productivity as compared to other developed nations. Hence the housing market is a substantial part of Canada's GDP. So if they were to allow a true correction, this could literally wreck the entire economy including pension funds etc.
2. Even if prices were to start falling, there's so much pent up demand that any meaningful increase in supply would be quickly tapped out and the demand will drive prices back up.
3. Most of the political parties that end up in power have no real motivation to fix this. Correcting the current housing shortage and ridiculous prices would mean substantially increasing supply, which would maybe one day cause prices to drop and still keep up with demand. A lot of people are banking on their house as being their retirement nest egg so they likely won't vote in a party that promises to bring affordable housing to all as that'll mean a decline in value in their 'investment'.",gzsy6sw,t3_nn5bz9,1622235981,1622261181.0,/r/ontario/comments/nn5bz9/just_hoping_to_start_a_discussion_and_see_what/gzsy6sw/,2021-05-28 21:06:21,2021-05

When the stock market corrects and people lose money, what do we usually say? Should have been smarter. Investors look at that situation and think amazing a flash sale.

And like in the stock market I would let the newly insolvent know that perhaps all their eggs in one basket was not a smart idea?

But as soon as someone with an iota of status loses a bit of money, everyone loves to rush to their defence: home owners, small businesses and so on, as of these people only lose through injustice done onto them and never through their own deserving stupidity.

Double so if these homeowners vote conservative, they have a home and vote for a party that preserves the home owning &gt; renting hierarchy (keeps the poor where they belong) while endorsing a party that maximizes their personal wealth and institutes barriers to anyone else trying to move up.

The ESA lays out basic terms for severance notice/pay typically two weeks if you have been there a year or more,  

There is also severance pay under common law for not-at-fault termination (which would be considered not-at-fault if they fired you for their business needs changing in a way that you can't accommodate)  common law severance is more complicated, and usually requires a lawyer, the total amount owed would take into account how long you have worked there, your age (if you are close to retirement thus have a harder time getting a new job), the level of this job (manger, etc), the ease of which you are likely to find replacement work, etc, etc.  

For a job that you work 8 hours a week, you probably wouldn't be entitled to much, if any common law severance, and if you were it likely wouldn't even cover the lawyer fees. 

I'd suggest polishing the resume, and start looking, tell them that you can't be there for 6am, if they hold firm and tell you that you need to quit, do not agree to that.

1760,jon372,ontario,"First, I want to say that I was a landlord in the past.   Single family homes, and duplexes.   I never owned more than one rental at a time, and all were previous homes that I lived in.   I typically rented to good tenants, never raised their rent, even after the longest was with with me for 5+ years.    If rent was ever an issue, I worked with the tenants to come up to date even if it took them a year to do so and in one case reduced their rent putting me in the hole as their retirement income was being hit in the market correction.  I did all repairs needed, hired out to professionals etc.    In all the time I’ve had property rented, and all the money and time  it cost me and eventually made me when I sold, I have never been so happy to be out of it.    

I probably made the worst financial decision of my life selling a good property, but seeing where landlord and tenants rights are going, I don’t want to be in that game.   When you make it impossible for good landlords by providing cover for bad tenants, you are only left with the bad landlords.   If they unionize tenants, then they must allow landlords to quickly evict, with union backing, tenants that are taking advantage.   They have to have a way for landlords to check for these tenants, and compensate them maybe through union fees when the tenant is found guilty.   They should also help float tenants that run into trouble through some shared dues.   Landlords have mortgages.   A lot of us are just trying to get ahead, and some, like in my case, found ourselves landlords due to market crashes/timing and because we hd good renters, didn’t sell so they wouldn’t be evicted.",gzkjday,t3_nlsdg8,1622068291,1622093491.0,/r/ontario/comments/nlsdg8/landlords_always_try_to_negotiate_with_tenants/gzkjday/,2021-05-26 22:31:31,2021-05

lol.  Not even close.  At any price.

I live in Ontario, and I still maintain US insurance with my company.  Ontario's healthcare is horrible in general (4 year wait to see an allergist, and to get a GP), but even if we look at a place with decent healthcare (like BC), it's still nowhere close.

When I had my shoulder surgery, I had it done by the surgeon for the local NBA team.  Despite having high failure rates for that particular procedure in general, it's still going strong a decade later.

I can pick almost any doctor I want, and it's not illegal for them to charge me.  I can often schedule in an app, and my copay is covered entirely by my health savings account.  Any extra money can be used tax deferred in retirement.

Sure, in Canada employer healthcare can get me dental coverage, some mental health, and prescription coverage.  What it can't get me is the ability to see who I want, almost whenever I want.

I have two friends who had fathers with Cancer.  The one in the US was a difficult to treat, generally fatal Cancer.  He went to the Mayo clinic, got amazing care, and is alive despite the odds.  The one in BC died.  He was waitlisted for a diagnostic test, then was too late to treat a normally treatable cancer.

1781,Adventurous_Salt,alberta,"A large percentage, probably over 50%, of the departments and teams that I've worked in or around have some degree of this. There's a large number of people who either can retire, or are fairly near retirement, and a relatively sparse number of people of any other age. The extent varies, but the trend is there and pretty consistent. 

This gets exacerbated with lay-offs - managers keep a greater percentage of their experienced friends (for multiple reasons, they do have experience, and they also just don't want to lay-off their buddies) and get rid of a larger percentage of less senior people. Obviously leading to fewer people actually being prepared to take on larger roles. 

As these people retire, companies look around, see few people who have developed experience to fill the roles, and scream for a lack of qualified candidates - as though skilled and experienced people just magically appear out of the sky. Develop your employees.",gyyvt9q,t3_nhsltd,1621619967,1621645167.0,/r/alberta/comments/nhsltd/alberta_businesses_struggling_to_find_qualified/gyyvt9q/,2021-05-21 17:59:27,2021-05
1782,Adventurous_Salt,alberta,"The popular thing I've seen in a few places I've worked is coming back as a consultant. Retire, collect their full pension, come back after a 3 month vacation and the managers that they worked with for the last 20 years hire them on as a semi-high (good, but not extreme) contract rate because they have ""the experience and the skills"" that the company just can't find, or wait to develop. Most people that I've seen do this are openly doing it because they just don't have anything else they want to do, and might as well get money instead of just sitting at home. I've never seen it happen because their specific skills are needed, the managers that are still employed are basically just giving their buddies some extra cash to blow on golf vacations.

This really hits a grand slam of stifling the career growth of those around them. Younger people don't get promoted, because the older people never leave. Things at the company don't get modernized, because there's 0 incentive for a retired 65 year old to go out of their way to learn new systems or tools, since they really don't care about the long term. Anything hard or boring gets dumped on the younger employees, since no one is coming out of retirement to do drudge work - thus minimizing the ability of the younger people to develop higher level skills or make critical decisions. The company ends up with a cohort of senior, high paid, employees all around the same age, which introduces serious issues for long term planning when 75% of a department is over 55. All of this leads to employees who would otherwise stay for years or decades look for other jobs, since their development is restricted - so the company loses a portion of the experienced, skilled employees they could otherwise be developing. 

I've been lucky enough to work at places that are pretty good employers overall, and this is pretty common almost anywhere that mid-senior level managers have the ability to do it. It is a total grift, giving your friends some easy cash instead of properly developing internal talent. Note: this is all relatively comfortable, fairly compensated, white collar work.

Nova Scotia does not have enough wealthy people to fund this, so shaking them down isn’t going to get you very far. Even if we did have a horde of millionaires - which we don’t - they would just leave if you made the tax system any more oppressive, and realistically it already makes no sense to stay here as it is. 

One of the arguments for UBI is that it will allow people to (somehow) take risks to better their earning potential and the like. There is NO evidence for this assumption, and a lot of cynical reasons to believe that a. Productive people would not benefit from UBI because they were already working in the first place and b. Unproductive people will continue to be unproductive. 

Yes, UBI would top-up the income paid to people at the lower rung, but you can deal with that far more efficiently via minimum wage, not a comically Byzantine income distribution plan. 

We should focus on the low-hanging fruit that could be addressed. That includes a stronger minion wage, stronger workers rights, and enhanced social assurance for folks with disabilities and the like. Those are concrete things that can be changed for the better - UBI, on the other hand, is a pipe dream which would only result in a reactionary backlash if implemented. 

At the end of the day our healthcare system is shot, the province can’t fund anything without going into debt to pay for it, and half the population is on the precipice of retirement.

1816,jjkggidnk886,ontario,"90k holding 620k in mortgage debt? 

When paying more the half your income to just your mortgage and then adding insurances, taxes, food, utility bills etc etc.... how much did you have to save for a rainy day or for retirement? (3000 -  1700$). How did you afford more then simply meeting your bills? Did you shop as second hand stores?

When folks couple up and a family starts they don’t go into a period of affluence. How do they get a home or unit? 

It sounds more like your looking at the very fortunate exception.

I started adult life with no debts. Mortgage is it and for a time a reasonable car loan. Aside from that nothing. No vacations, no tripping, no booze or smoking, not big on gifts or parties, no expensive stuff in my home. Started at 50k and that was above the combined house income of my city then by a fair amount. Since then salary has climbed for me but not my wife. Daycare is crippling if you’d plan to own a home as deeply in mortgage debt as your example situations were put. Lots of moms have to go to work to pay daycare so they don’t loose what is a good job in the area.

Much of Ontario people need a vehicle.

Better in a building than in my back yard, and I don't have to be a selfish asshole. It's a win-win.  


The way you do it is by building government housing and renting out at a lower rate. This will kick competition into gear, forcing other landlords to lower rents. Saskatchewan does this with cell phones with SaskTel, and surprise surprise, Rogers and other carriers match their prices in Saskatchewan. It's not impossible. I am a huge fan of government-run corporations as they are, at least partially, beholden to the voters and not pure profits. We don't need to house everyone in government housing, just enough that it makes other rents look and feel overpriced.  


If housing is an investment, where is the risk? I'm sorry, but the government should not be tipping the scales to try and prevent a much needed market correction in housing. If the government wants to prop up housing prices because that is most Canadians retirement, then they should foot the bill for housing for people who are left behind.

- schools/day cares are actively looking for Covid cases and sending kids home routinely with any sign of a symptom, while we've seen many reports now of workplaces ignoring or turning a blind eye to it,
- kids in day care right now especially are predominantly children of essential workers who are significantly more likely to get Covid than stay-at-home parents.

1824,Mister_Abendsen,ontario,"I've lived in a few places in Canada and in the States, so I've seen a variety of systems. Saskatchewan had one of the best; Ontario has one of the worst right now. Most of that comes down to funding and access. The US system is convenient and speedy, and there are rafts of specialists, but extremely expensive, inequitable, and burdensome (as far as paperwork and administration go).   


As someone else mentioned, specialists are huge in the States, whereas in Canada that happens by referral only. The same thing with the whole ""ask your doctor about..."" thing: common in the US, non-existent in Canada. I know people in the States who would walk into their doctor's office, list their symptoms, ask for a particular med, and walk out with a script. That's almost unheard of here (and probably should be). The explosion of opioid and stimulant usage has made doctors very hesitant to prescribe pain meds and ADHD meds over time.  


Where I am now in Ontario, it's almost impossible to find a family doctor. I've been on a wait list for three years now, which means using walk-in clinics and things like Maple (which I heartily recommend), but that also means that there isn't continuity of care at all, to say nothing of having a relationship with a care provider. Most of that is due to underfunding over the years, the exploding costs of a medical education, and fewer people opting to do general care. That, coupled with the Baby Boomers hitting retirement  (so. many. CT scans.) and COVID has kind of thrown everything into perpetual crisis mode. 20 years ago it was a world-class system. Right now it's really bending under the weight of underfunding, demographics, and mismanagement. It's really unfortunate.

1844,mikonamiko,ontario,"&gt; TORONTO, May 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —

 Wine Rack workers voted 86% in support of strike action yesterday. The workers, members of SEIU Local 2, say low wages, basic job security and fairness are all key issues. Wine Rack is owned by the Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan through one of its holdings, Arterra Wines Canada.


The workers say they are being asked to accept terms that would not address a severe problem with their hours and job security. Current wages and working conditions have resulted in a stunning annual employee turnover rate of 50%. Workers are seeking a deal which will give them the ability to work sufficient hours at a fair wage. Wine Rack has so far refused to provide workers with this basic level of dignified work. In addition, management has proposed a Manager-in-Training program which workers say is a thinly veiled scheme to further erode their hours, if not eviscerate their union altogether.


“The hours are divvied up on a basis that is completely arbitrary, and the scheduling varies greatly from week to week,” said Francesco Lo Presti, a Toronto-area employee. “We are asking for a little fairness. The fluctuating income makes it difficult to reconcile one’s bills at the end of the month with this type of precarious work.”


Lo Presti and his co-workers are asking their employer to assign hours using seniority, to ensure that current employees can expect to receive sufficient hours to earn enough to make ends meet. But Wine Rack management is insisting on retaining the right to arbitrarily assign hours to new hires or preferred employees without regard to years of service.


Constellation Brands Canada (subsequently renamed Arterra Wines Canada) was acquired by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan in 2016, making this attack on workers especially disappointing given that a Union pension fund owns Wine Rack.


“I think it’s great that teachers have unions and have been able to make a good living,” said Radha Bhagat, a Toronto-area employee. “I also think that all workers, especially those of us on the minimum wage end, deserve that chance too.”

Workers will continue to come to the table and work to reach a fair deal but say they will not compromise on basic job security and fairness. They are also planning on launching a public campaign to raise awareness amongst Ontario teachers. They want to make sure teachers know how one of their pension fund assets, is treating workers.


“We’ll be asking teachers not to build their retirement security at our expense,” said Bhagat.

1846,The_WolfieOne,ontario,"Ford set out in bad faith from day one, when he decided to hide the Mandate letters, a first in Ontario politics. Every government we've ever had, made theirs available for public access. Whether this was his decision, or the decision of the ONPC party itself is immaterial.  
He surrounded himself with a hand picked group of co-conspirators who paid sufficient obsequiousness to his Narcissism and  would toe his lines. The party left it all in his hands, so they are equally complicit in his crimes.

Conservatives across the country are united in one thing, and that is that they consider profit and business more important than human lives, the ONPC is no different. The entire LTC homes massacre was set up by former ONPC Premier Mike Harris in order to pad his retirement from politics with profits, and all of his privatization and corporate collusion was picked up by Ford decades after his reign. So what's the common thread between the two Premiers? Yeah, the ONPC.  


This is all on the Party. This is what the ONPC party has become, and what all Canadian Conservative parties have become, a slightly more intelligent, yet equally vile and greedy, clone of the the American Republican Party.  


They have gone so far right, that they've dragged the Left past the centre. Which is why the Liberals, at least at the federal level, are pro-corporate toadies. Easily demonstrated by forking over well over $20 billion to the oil industry since they came to power in the form of pipelines, and various subsides.

1847,Sharond832,PEI,"Full Disclosure: I work in the financial/insurance industry. 

A good advisor is well worth your time and the fees are often built into the funds so you aren't paying out of pocket. They can explain the details of TFSA vs RRSP and which one makes the most sense for your personal situation, help you understand risk vs return and find a fund that suits your comfort level and time horizon, plan for tax season and help you minimize your tax bill, explain the options for long term retirement and estate planning, etc, etc.

There are definitely weekend warrior advisors who took the course and will put minimal effort into your plan and then you never hear from them. They give the entire industry a bad name. You can do a lot for yourself but when you factor in the time you are taking to learn the ins and outs and then actively manage it over years vs meeting with a professional once or twice a year, most people should be meeting with a professional. 

I can confidently recommend Joe White at Navigate Financial because I've worked with him and seen first hand the effort he puts into helping clients make the right decision, even when what's right for the client means he's not going to make any money on that transaction. 

Stephanie Andrews at IG Wealth Management is also an excellent Advisor with a great reputation.

Literally anywhere else in the world, if you're 20 minutes outside of a city...you're still in that city.

We had dirt dirt dirt cheap land commuting distance from our cities for years, and nothing happened. Nobody was interested.

Baby boomers are Canada's biggest demographic. The boomers are hitting retirement age and Covid-19 was the catalyst for a lot of them to make the change.

Most of Canada's population is densely packed into high Cost of Living cities like Toronto and Vancouver. Boomers in those areas are sitting on massive real estate value and salaries more than twice the median *family* income in NB.

Those two factors have resulted in a migration of rich retirees to the Atlantic provinces. This is driving up the real estate market, the Cost of Living, and the cost of government services like healthcare. If New Brunswick does not adapt and plan for this change, we will be economically screwed.

This isn't just my opinion either. This all comes from official StatsCan and Provincial reports.",gxr6k5x,t3_n9yhml,1620755252,1620780452.0,/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/n9yhml/the_new_normal_nb_rental_crisis/gxr6k5x/,2021-05-11 17:47:32,2021-05

1881,Bond4141,saskatchewan,"1. First link thinks this is a ""severe"" virus, lol. On top of that, this ""source"" is nothing more than bullshit. It doesn't state anything, it seems to take great effort in order NOT to state anything. ""Might"", ""Suggests"", ""If"". It's terrible. Then it goes on to compare a cruise ship, which typically have older people, with some cruises having an [average age in the 60s](https://www.cruise1st.co.uk/blog/cruise-holidays/how-old-is-the-average-cruise-passenger/#:~:text=Whilst%20the%20average%20cruiser%20is,to%20find%20a%20younger%20crowd.) compared to a meat processing factory, which likely has an average worker age *bellow* retirement. Age matters, as we know the average age of death for the WuFlu is in the 80s, we can also imply that the older generation will be more likely to get symptoms, and as a result, fully explains why younger people in a working factory are more likely to be asymptomatic and healthy, compared to old people on vacation, presumably retired, on a cruise. 

2. This uses theoretical tests with a new mask in a lab environment. It's not at all representative of day to day life, and is in no way a valid source. 

3. This is an oppinion piece in a paper. Also, here's a quote. ""There is a lack of good, robust evidence on the effectiveness of standard face masks worn by the public."" and "" In the meantime, there are plenty of things we can do now to keep ourselves safe and healthy. But for now, the jury on face masks is still out."". Did *you* read your fucking source?

4. This ""source"" also links to laboratory tests with no real world relevance. It's second source shows a minimal decrease, much as with the CDC study, and again, is irrelevant. It then talks about death rates, which we should all be aware isn't at all a representative number. [“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.](https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/). Again, a bum source. 

5. ""T-shirts, and towels were associated with filtration efficiency of 10% to 40% in experiments using NaCl aerosol"" Again, a useless non relevant lab test that doesn't in any way represent real life. 

6. ""“There is this theory that facial masking reduces the [amount of virus you get exposed to] and disease severity,”"" this is an idiotic take. Compared to the body, any amount of virus particles would be insignificant. You can't get ""Super sick"". Either you get sick and it replicates in the body, or you don't get sick. This is what an incubation period is all about. On top of that, this is based around a mask protecting the wearer, not others, and has nor relevance to mask mandates. You're free to wear a mask, I don't care. Making me wear one because you're afraid of a virus however is selfish. 

7. ""As a surgeon, I spent much of my life behind a mask."" Surgeons don't need masks. [However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination. More rigorous contemporary research is needed to make a definitive comment on the effectiveness of surgical facemasks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/) This would be like stabbing yourself in the hand, then saying others who don't want to stab their hands are silly because you do it. 

8. This is twitter. 

9. This is a coating that claims to kill the virus on the surface of the mask. It's in no way relevant to this conversation, and at most would make it safe to re-use a mask by shoving it in a pocket. As people already do, without issue. 

10. I don't watch youtube. I'm assuming this is another pointless lab test, or some stupid candle blowing test. The title talks about N95 masks, which aren't used in any considerable numbers, and isn't part of the conversation, as any regulation enforcing N95s would be racist, Sexist, and go against the freedom of religion.

11. A doctor put on 7 masks for 70 minutes while sitting and you think that's in any way representative of a runner, sports player, or even an electrician? The fact you included a 70 second video as ""proof"" is laughable. 

12. See above. she had a heart rate of 68. Get back to me when she's pushing 160 and her body is actually demanding oxygen. Again, this doesn't show masks work in any capacity. 

13. This is a story about wearing a mask for smoke during a wildfire. From the own story, even though it states that the WuFlu Virus is nearly 1/4th the size of a smoke particle, non n95+ masks are not recommended. 

14. See #2

15. This one shows masks aren't good at preventing illnesses. ""Masks did not provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting cold."" 

16. This isn't a study. This is that Shahab idiot going on about telling people to wear masks. 

17. This is about Asbestos. Go wear a cloth mask and redo my facility and we'll talk. 

So there you go. Most of your ""sources"" didn't even talk about mask effectiveness, but rather talk about completely different topics altogether.

1893,MountainsAB,alberta,"FYI: my mother died having had similar symptoms for a day and a half.
Deep vein thrombosis, clot moved from her leg, bypassed her lungs, and broke up into 3larger clots and 5smaller clots. They blocked every artery outside her heart. 
She died in 2005.

So yes, I would I did call after she passed out I the floor and woke up with blood dripping from her nose and ear, and was unresponsive for 3min. She died 4hrs after being admitted to the ICU. 
Whatever the facts are for this family, it will come out. 

Not everyone reacts the same, not everyone seeks a second or third answer from doctors or ER, because we are rush to listen to the doctor.  Media tells you to stay home and isolate if you have symptoms.

Guess what- medical personnel so screw up. Found out after my mom died that it was clear to paramedics that she might have had a clot. The paramedic in charge checked of that he had done the checks for blood clot, including measuring above and below her knee. Yet when she was admitted at hospital they double check and indicate right away that there was a 3.5 inch difference between the ensure measurements above her knees, and massive swelling and bruising. 
We sued, no for money, but to have the courts release the files and force the paramedic to testify under oath. That is when it came out in the wash that he had a long history of not actually doing his job, but claiming he did. Apparently sometimes he was tiered, and couldn’t be bothered to actually check stuff. He got in trouble with his own professional groups and entered early retirement. We never sued for money as the family lawyer made clear it was extremely difficult to prove. It was concluded that the paramedics actions delayed proper medical care from being administered in a timely manner.

Whole purpose for suing was to get that paramedic out of an ambulance.

So I would really wait until there is hopefully an investigation into all of this. Sometimes suing is the only way to get facts out in the open, and is not always done for concise benefit.

I was 19 when my mom died, and in my second year, so I can imagine how this girl feels. 

Remember that she is 20. I am now 35, how I would have felt with things at this age would have been vastly different in calling in care even earlier.

1906,fooz42,ontario,"Seniority is actually about button-pushing unions. It's about unskilled labour not being marketable. And the longer you work at a factory pushing buttons as an unskilled labourer, the less marketable you are. Therefore, the long-serving employees are the most protected because they are the most at risk. It doesn't actually make sense for teaching, which is a knowledge worker profession.

For knowledge work, experience is not the same as competence. Ontario teachers are some of the best in the world. Many have graduate degrees. If you invest that much in your own education, as professionals, most have pride in their work. Every single teacher I know complains about lame ducks hanging on until retirement or idiot teachers they have to work with. They just want to work with great coworkers, like anyone else. Being forced to work with idiots is demoralizing.

The ventilation thing is complicated. Initially parents councils were blocked from buying ventilation due to equity issues, which is a much longer standing issue. Regardless, ahead of the September start, the unions focused on class sizes, which is their usual complaint, and gummed up ventilation and equipment. The province eventually walked away because the unions were using the pandemic to win concessions on class sizes.

This is not in the press exactly, though Ford did have at least one press conference I recall where he was mewing about this specifically, but it would make sense if you were in the room during the discussions.

While there was federal and provincial money specifically targeting ventilation, there was also budget allocations given to each board to spend as they needed. Most of that went to payroll, because of class sizes, leaving inadequate equipment.

Unions of course want more payroll, because it means more members, so that was their priority even if it wasn't optimal from a pandemic response point of view.

Believe me or not, my reading of the situation is not without reasoning.

I think the ETFO have not been focused on the fact we're in a global pandemic. They have very much been playing the situation for their selfish reasons, instead of taking an attitude of ""we're in it together."" Most every other sector of society has done their part without playing it for leverage, but not the ETFO.

Just look at their statements from Christmas into the new year. They started begging for a lockdown in December. The government relented and kept schools closed in January. Then, they experienced significant blowback from their own members, many of whom are parents; and of course, parents in general. In January, they immediately began attacking the government for closing schools--the very policy they were demanding. They are faithless.

Gay marriage became legal across Canada in 2003, and most legal benefits commonly associated with marriage have been extended to cohabiting same-sex couples since 1999. Before this time, the letter of the law said you didn't need to extend rights.  

So you have this grey area extending back from 1999, where employees contacts don't expressly say you need to extend benefits to their spouse, but socially it is the right thing to do.  Or to put this all together, this policy only effects people who:

1) qualified for retirement (55 is CN's minimum retirement age) before 1999 and

2) Are considered cohabiting same-sex partners.

This means, for this to be an issue for you, you have to have a same sex partner who is dead, but was a 77 or older retiree from CN.

1921,Ok_Lab_8380,saskatchewan,"&gt;*In the scientific world, a direct study like the one I'm citing provides better information than a meta study like the one you're citing. In addition, direct studies are more reliable than studies which ""estimate the proportion of COVID-19 cases who were asymptomatic for each included study population, assuming a binomial distribution and calculating exact Clopper–Pearson confidence intervals"". To be specific, the study I'm referring to used the same methodology for nearly 10 million subjects, and specifically tested for the virus, and specifically checked to see if the positive subjects experienced symptoms. They found no cases of asymptomatic spread and only 300 asymptomatic cases. Surely you see that one will yield better data than the other. It also directly conflicts with a higher quality study with a much larger sample size. If we're following ""the science,"" then we're following my study.*

You use that ten million person study like it is an unquestionable truth. Sure, a ten million person study conducted with simple, direct methods, is an important study, but it should not be held up like some new bible, an absolute law. You seem like someone with relevant background. Surely you understand that there are no absolutes, or unquestionable truths in science, only ""laws"" that have been proven over and over again, millions of times. That certainly isn't the case with any Covid-related study. And it is not the only study that has been conducted on asymptomatic spread. That is why it is important to compare studies and see what agrees and what doesn't. Studies that don't agree with another aren't tossed aside, but kept in consideration, as the standards they are conducted according to show that they do have meaning, even if they disagree with every other study.

Yes my study is a meta-analysis, but it definitely has value. It was a survey of multiple studies similar to yours, (yours may even be included in it). Of the studies included, five had data on asymptomatic transmission. Two studies found that the asymptomatic transmission rate was 0%, (0 of 91 cases and 0 of 4 cases), one found it to be 0.3% (one of 305 cases), one found it to be 0.8% (1 of 119 cases), and one found it to be 2.2% (15 of 691). While two of the studies say that there is not asymptomatic transmission, we have three studies, conducted in different geographic regions, with different methods, all coming to the same conclusion: that covid 19 asymptomatic transmission is possible. That is not even accounting for pre-symptomatic transmission, a significant part of the spread.

 Multiple, independent investigations, conducted in a variety of ways, arriving at the same conclusion, warrants attention and consideration. Public health officials have looked at these studies, ones that prove asymptotic transmission is a thing and ones like yours that prove it is not, and make the best, most-informed decisions they can. 

*If this is a concern for you, here are some options: mask up. Double mask, even. wear other PPE stay home and collect free money order things to your door Here is a list of things that aren't an option for you:force the entire country to wear masks and operate their businesses at reduced capacity*

The trouble with this is that there are people that do not have the option to stay home. For example, as long as restaurant dining halls are open, their waiters cannot collect the covid unemployment benefits. The PPE isn't perfect. Closing in-person dining and bars would have massive losses for owners, and something should be done for them. They are the ones bearing the economic brunt to combat the virus.

*The theme is, you can control yourself. You don't get to arbitrarily boss everyone else around.*

The virus infects indifferently. It doesn't only target people who don't take it seriously. If some people are doing all they can to stop the spread and not get it, and others are continuing to go out and closely mingle sans masks, they will spread it and make it more likely that those who do take it seriously will contract it. We have given the government the mandate to boss everyone around through the laws it passes and measures it enacts. There are measures in place to prevent tyranny of the majority, as we discussed earlier, but I doubt that any court would say that forcing people to wear masks in public buildings would constitute such tyranny.

*The appropriate comparison is between states with similar health care systems and populations, like California vs Florida. And we're not even getting into the different methods of counting coronavirus deaths. In the US, if you die with the virus, you died of it. This isn't the case in Canada, NZ, Australia, and elsewhere.*

Sweden and Norway are both similar countries, with similar, state-funded healthcare systems. Sweden famously decided to not have any lockdowns or other measures early on, thinking that deaths were inevitable from the disease and that locking down and making people wear masks would not save them. Sweden has had 14 901 deaths of a population of 10 380 000, 0.14% of their population, or 1.4 in 1000. Norway, its neighbour, had lockdowns and social distancing measures, 757 deaths of a population of 5 391 000, 0.014%, or 1.4 in 10 000. The measures reduce deaths by a factor of ten.

*Lastly, if preventing 1 of a thousand people from dying requires doing what we've done for the last year, then I'm out. Let them die. Most of them are elderly who already lived their lives (and lived them mask-and-lockdown free, I might add!).*

This is probably your most important point. Many places that are nice to live in with good  governments (as good as they can be) have opted to go this route. Why should we sacrifice and drastically alter out lives to save one in a thousand people? For starters, the disease has many nasty long side affects for people who recover from it that we are learning more and more about. It is not just a lung disease, it has long-term effects on the hearts and brains on even the people who experience mild cases. [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351) Who knows the cost this will have on our health system, as well as our friends and family? 

*Most of them are elderly who already lived their lives (and lived them mask-and-lockdown free, I might add!).* 

Our current ICU situation says otherwise, as younger thirty and forty year olds are filling them. The sixty year olds are still at risk, and they're just at the age where they are reaching retirement. They shouldn't be robbed of their retirement years because people couldn't wear a mask. (It's really not that bad). And even if it were just the elderly, we should still do what it takes to protect them. In the last century there was another society that looked at people that don't contribute to society as drags on society. Looking at them as numbers and not as individuals, it made economic sense to remove the negative numbers, which resulted in the deaths of the people seen as drags on society. I think the more different we are from that society, which treated people as numbers rather than individuals, the better. 

There have been other times in history when entire societies have mobilized, sacrificed, and fought for people that would never know them nor their sacrifice. I see this pandemic as our generation's chance to do something similar, to mobilize on a vast scale to prevent as many deaths as possible, except for us, wearing a mask and social distancing are small prices to pay to save a life.",gx00o4c,t3_mymkog,1620197915,1620223115.0,/r/saskatchewan/comments/mymkog/so_why_are_the_police_ph_officers_allowed_to_not/gx00o4c/,2021-05-05 06:58:35,2021-05

Haven't you just *extremely* contradicted your own position?

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on though. According to [this](https://www.populationpyramid.net/canada/2020/) resource Canada's young adult cohorts are relatively equal with it's middle-aged to retirement-aged cohorts. There isn't any bump in the young adult population, so why do you think that that would start a unique demand spike this year? Wouldn't a large amount of people at ""household creation"" age cause the growth in housing prices to ramp up over time? Not to mention, the rate of ""failure to launch"" youth is ever-increasing, since the early 2000s. You think, in the middle of skyrocketing prices, flatlining incomes, and a pandemic, that *more* young people are striking out? That goes against all other metrics.

Really simply, foreigners are a minor part of our housing market. Those buying a home to live in when they get here are welcome. Those buying housing to park finance or to extract rent are not. If they're buying without arriving, they're by far most likely the latter.

It doesn't explain the massive increase in price, especially since it should be at least countered by the much more drastic drop in immigration.

Just look at the record price fishermen are getting for crab this year. Sure there is the whole supply and demand factor, but it was the union who stood fast and maximized the profit for the fishermen. Go FFAW!

In turn these people will be purchasing Cadillac Escalades and GMC Denali pickups instead of regular pickups. Their spouses will have a car or two. Their children won’t be bullied at school because they will be able to have the expensive clothes and even their own cars. That’s a union!

COVID mortality rates would be higher if it weren’t for the nurses union. 

Our children’s education would be compromised if not for the teacher’s union. 

The public sector would have collapsed years ago if not for the courageous hard work and dedication of NAPE. 

And then you have CUPE, Carpenters, IBEW, Steelworkers, Teamsters, Pipefitters, labourer’s, etc. 

Do you think the Molson and Labatt plants in St. John’s would still be open if they were not unionized? Doubtful. That’s the power of a union! 

If we could get every industry and every position unionized the standard of living would increase and the unions would have more power than the politicians. That’s a union! 

Take the excess money away from the employers and funnel that money to the employees and the unions. Make employers more accountable to their employees. Give them more benefits, sick days, personal days, pensions, and the power to say “No”!  That’s a union! 

Unions can take the money from union dues and pensions to invest in stock, bonds, currency, etc. investments for infrastructure and economic development. Make lots of money for the brothers and sisters retirement. 

Given enough time and enough industries unionized we could eventually help the members further by influencing change. Unions would be able to purchase majority stock in its members companies. Get on the Board of Director’s to influence greater profits. They would be able to issue all loans so members wouldn’t have to be accountable to a specific bank. The unions would take care of them. Every member should have unrestricted and nonpayment for legal services at their disposal. Unions could do that.

1963,FizixMan,ontario,"Possibly. They can still have been in the ICU for a while, even from near the start of the third wave. Regardless, for the amount of people getting infected and in the ICU for this third wave, the amount of death is notably proportionally lower than either of those first two waves. (Albeit we know this is still a lagging indicator.) So I think the vaccines are working, but on the scale of the millions of people in Ontario, it's not going to be 100% effective in stopping _all_ hospitalizations and _all_ deaths, especially with the extra severity of the VOC strains dominating cases right now.

We also know that outbreaks in LTC are far lower this third wave as compared to the second wave (e.g., 60 outbreaks in LTC/retirement homes now vs 391 on January 8th). I think it's fair to say we'd be in a far, far worse position if not for the vaccinations we already had, and it'll only get better as we approach herd immunity levels. If we have a fourth wave, with even 80% of us fully vaccinated, it'll probably be far less severe and have far less death than even this wave, hopefully something relatively inconsequential.

As for proportionally that it's mostly seniors dying, well that's just how it is right now.

&gt;Long-term care homes are [still being compensated for empty beds](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-to-fully-fund-nursing-homes-despite-lower-occupancies/) as well. Many retirement homes, on the other hand, have been struggling to fill beds.

&gt; Just finished interviews with two experts on senior's health who raised serious concerns about this. I'll try to encapsulate. This isn't like transferring someone to get care in another hospital, this is sending them to a home they've chosen not to live in.

&gt;Plus a lot of the homes with vacancies right now are the ones that made headlines for the high number of deaths during the pandemic. Plus a lot of the homes still face severe staffing shortages and a ""bolus"" of admissions could compromise care for the entire home.

&gt;There's no guarantee the transfers will be close to family, although that's the hope, and there isn't any clarity on the duration of the transfers or an exit plan.

&gt;Both said to some extent the crisis in hospitals means this could, regretfully, be justified if it means another patient will get acute care they need and couldn't access otherwise.

1970,bitter-optimist,ontario,"Funnily enough, the utterly insane demographics are part of why things are just economically screwy.  The world after ~1930 - 1970 or so is fundamentally unlike the world before.

No culture or society has ever before faced issues like a third or half of the population being elderly before. Humans, and our economies and social institutions, developed in an environment where the young heavily outnumber the middle aged and where the retirement age elderly were downright rare. 

In a capitalist market economy, the upper middle class can accumulate a great deal of wealth and then sit on it while not being economically productive for 30 - 50 years in later life.  Similar issues exist with advanced medical care and social welfare programs.

Barely half of the Canadian population is engaged in regular economic labour.  But labour must continue to happen and production must continue to maintain the standard of living.  An increasing proportion of each labour hour must be allocated to keeping people who do not or cannot work supported, either through taxes or their share of wealth held privately.

This is a very exceptional situation, unlike anything ever encountered by any culture or society before.  That number is usually around 90% with all but a few elderly and very young children working.  We're in uncharted waters here.

We need creative and innovative approaches for social welfare and labour and wealth allocation or it's going to get very ugly as this trend continues.  It is unsustainable as the effective standard of living for young people who need to be starting homes and families cannot afford to do so.  Then again, maybe the trend won't continue.

1971,RoboticEnterprise,ontario,"Like I said again and again.

 You don't have to vote Liberal just don't vote for the Conservative Party in the next election. This alone will seal their fate. The conservative party for years have been playing the GTA against the city of Toronto while maintaining control of the deeply rural areas of Ontario. However with their handling of the pandemic, their inaction on the worsening housing crisis and the extremely poor performance at handling the province in general there is probably going to be a precipitous crash in the Cons ability to maintain any sort of majority in Queen's Park.

1) A section of their voter base have unfortunately died due to COVID-19. It's a standard practice by the Conservative to garner votes from older seniors. There are numerous photos of Doug Ford meeting in Retirement Centers and asking for their vote. Going to be a lot harder to gather the ""easy"" vote if those people are simply dead.

2) When they didn't address the deepening housing crisis over the past four years and simply charged ahead they created a situation where people in Toronto were becoming immensely unhappy with the inability to secure housing on their budget. When COVID hit suddenly a bunch of Torontonians (who are mainly Liberal or NDP voters) looked around and said if I can work from home then I'll work anywhere in Ontario. Which as we can see is now driving liberal/NDP voters out of Toronto and into the GTA and further. This now dilutes the conservative party's hold as people from Toronto are leaving in record numbers and taking up residences in mainly conservative ridings. Most Torontonians really really hate Doug Ford and the Conservative party (I'm talking rage-hate) mainly because of way he has treated them. Toronto itself will stay mainly a Liberal/NDP/Green party riding - due to the fact that it has such a high concentration of people.  Will this affect the next election? Yup. Remember that some rural seats are won by a smaller tally of votes on a First Past the post system. 

3) Poor general performance overall. Last election the conservatives mainly ran on a ""No Kathleen Wynne"" policy but didn't really propose any real progress policy changes. When they entered office they simply instituted ""Corporate Donor based policies"" that actually had no affect on the conservative population of Ontario. In fact some of the policies they instituted were famously anti-rural and were more slanted towards corporate favoritism. Basically the Ontario CPC is a party that has not really serviced the majority of their own voters and instead simply used their time in parliament to garner funds from private donors while putting in place policies that hurt the conservative voter and non-conservative voter equally. I'd reckon that the only people that have truly benefitted from Doug Ford's woefully poor performance is the Wealthy Conservative Donors/Corporate Lobbyists.

The Ontario Conservative Party will most likely experience a disharmonious rebalancing in the next election and may have actually ruined their chances for years to come.",gw6ph25,t3_n0cyyy,1619625883,1619651083.0,/r/ontario/comments/n0cyyy/covid19_has_turned_ontario_into_canadas_havenot/gw6ph25/,2021-04-28 16:04:43,2021-04

1975,mattchew1993,ontario,"&gt; ""Work/life balance"" is a new term and not something that was given any consideration up until recently by employers.

What? My Dad's generation, while still worked hard, had a far better work/life balance. He had a union job, worked 8 hours on the dot with an hour's worth of breaks in that time. When he worked, dual income wasn't needed to survive. Mom stayed home with the kid, ran errands during the work hours and when my Dad came home dinner was ready. His income could support the family while still affording the fun things like a vacation here and there. The best part was his job offered a nice pension - so no matter what, after 30 years of service he could kick his feet up and receive a paycheck for doing nothing.   


Fast-forward to now, my job is 9 - 5... only if I don't take a break. If I take a half-hour for lunch the expectation is to work until 5:30. My partner also has to work so that we can afford the rent, meaning errands have to be done when we get home. Dinner can't be started during work hours, so when we get home we have to spend an hour or so cooking. By the time daily chores/errands/cooking is done, we might have an hour or two to kick our feet up before calling it a night and doing it all again the next day. And what do we have to look forward to? Many jobs don't offer pensions anymore so retirement is a pipedream.

&gt;At this private sector chain of long-term-care homes, the executives “gave themselves perfect scores” for their handling of the pandemic, according to the Globe and Mail, and handed out bonuses at 86 per cent of targets — more than in 2019 before the pandemic.


&gt;Chief executive Vlad Volodarski made $1.91 million, including a $323,967 bonus — more than twice what he made in 2019 as chief financial officer. Bonuses for three other top executives were $187,187 and $207,627 for total paycheques between $1.04 million and $1.17 million.

That gives people an incentive to NOT use their sick days when they are sick because that's basically giving up a day of future vacation/early retirement, so they'll still come in in questionable health, infect their class, etc.  

IMO sick days should be unlimited (with some sort of verification required after 5+ days) but not bankable and if they're unused, they're unused.  Congrats! You weren't sick, that's a good thing.

1993,huskytogo,ontario,"Yes, my last paragraph stated this. People who bought their house 30+ years ago, raised their family and retired, now only collecting CPP and whatever savings they had would get really screwed by this.

In certain cases like that there would have to be a failsafe. Maybe in certain cases (living in same home for 20+ years, paid off or almost paid off (less than 20% total mortgage left) and retired, property taxes would not reflect the new law until the house is sold etc. I don't know how the land transfer tax would affect the sale when it is sold in this case either.

I'm not really sure. I also don't think this proposal ^ is the best idea, or even a good one, but I  agree with you and did recognize that it would be a problem and there should be some fail safe. I think the land transfer tax was working very well up until 15 or so years ago but it does seem sort of broken now. There would be a lot of other problems that could come up as well. Someone in their late 50s, close to retirement would be screwed. People with HELOCs would be screwed, people who just bought a house for 1M now valued at X% lower would be screwed etc. There are definitely a ton of problems that could and would happen.

Essentially though, we know our tax system is broken since lots of the wealthy don't pay their share. We know our housing market is broken since young people can't buy houses. We know there are a ton of empty properties bought by foreign investors to launder money. I think implementing this, and grandfathering it in a way that protects vulnerable people yet helps people afford houses, plus gives the lower/middle lower class more disposable income to theoretically invest (education/health/financial) and climb the ladder would be a good topic of discussion.

2004,bitter-optimist,alberta,"You can buy property in Canada.  Most Americans are eligible to enter Canada for up to 6 month visits, whether for business or personal reasons.  The most common disqualification is having any convictions for crimes that would be considered serious.  (A conviction for DUI is the most common issue.)

To actually reside here you would need a visa of some kind.  The tourist visa is valid for 6 months and technically you have to return to the USA when it expires.  No, we don't really aggressively enforce it.  Americans who are independently wealthy can and do reside here for years without trouble.  But you could be deported at any time if you interact with the authorities and they notice you aren't here legally.  (And you may be barred from returning after that.)

As a visitor, you cannot legally work, and you are not eligible for social programs or public healthcare (so you have to pay cash or be privately insured to get medical care).  So if you want a seasonal cabin, spend the summer and fall here each year, sure you can do that.  

If you want to live here year-round, both legally and practically speaking, you pretty much have to get some kind of permanent residency (equivalent to a green card) and probably naturalize as a citizen eventually.

Those fees ensure that the total fee revenue collected is equal to the total annual cash cost of operating the system, no more and no less.

Ah yes, The Beer Store, the champion of philanthropic virtues in Ontario.   The company that fights tooth and nail for their monopoly contract to continue in perpetuity, constantly threatening to sue the province, is just doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.

You should be more aware of what your position is as a freelancer and be building vacation pay and time off into your own fees and scheduling. You need to take into account all of the things that are not being paid. Health, dental and vision benefits, vacation pay, time off, EI payments, CPP, taxes, retirement plan/pension. 

I know nothing about you but your lack of understanding of the ESA and employees vs freelance contractors makes me think you are undercharging. There is a guide to the ESA below.

There are pros and cons to freelancing and to being an employee. Depending on your life situation (marriage, age, kids) some of the benefits are worth more peace of mind than the extra money. Do you pay into any health benefits on your own? Health benefits are an added expense that can be worth it if you have a even one major health issue.

The delay is because the pro's of getting more people vaccinated is deemed to outweigh the potential con of a lower efficacy.

41-54 should be next. Less active, closer to retirement age. 55-70 should follow, since this group is a significantly less active and likely retired. You could also open up faster this way, since the real spreaders are mostly vaccinated.

2065,RTJaa9,newfoundland,"&gt; And math. Look at the population in ON compared to NL. If they donated every single vax they ever had it wouldn’t even do a retirement village up here, let alone get to the workers who are the main source of the spread. It would make an tiny different and totally derail both federal and provincial vaccine roll outs. The feds are rolling out vaccines in a calculated manner to be as effective as possible.  

No, the feds aren't doing that. And it's not like sending 10k-20k vaccines from here would gum things up. They could just continue to roll out their plan as normal.

A tiny difference is lives. Don't lose sight of the fact that you're arguing for extra deaths in ON at very little expense here. Delaying 10k vaccines here very likely won't result in any extra deaths given our case count and control systems. 

What does any of this have to do with math other than to show your bad at it can't see anything past the relative size of the provinces?

&gt; Giving up the vaccine would like Ralph sitting on the bus going “I’m helping”. 

No, there is issues with rollout, there's issues with people not taking the vaccine up there. We're in agreement though that if the ON bottleneck was getting shots in arms it would be a different story. That's not the issue from my vantage point. So no, it's not like Ralph.

Question - if the bottleneck is not where you suspect, would it change your calculus here? Would you become pro NL sending the vaccines? 

&gt; I’m not sharing this to have the last word, I think it’s genuinely important people have a concept of public health.

2068,ravenscanada,NovaScotia,"When someone moves here with an out-of-province job they contribute to our economy in a way no other migrant possibly can. They pay taxes in Nova Scotia, they spend money in Nova Scotia, and they don’t “steal anyone’s job”. They are likely to be higher paid, too, if they continue to get Ontario wages while living here. 

There are secondary benefits that are more qualitative but are real. They are an employed knowledge worker (usually) who is likely going to contribute to our society. Many of the complaints against immigrants typically focus on an imaginary worst-case migrant. A lazy, unemployable oaf who will come here with his weird ways and mooches off the system. That is definitely not what we would be getting. 

Finally, there is the downside of the housing costs, which many of us are feeling. But that is a double-edged sword. Every house that sells for 100k over asking and displaces a first-time home buyer also puts an extra 100k in the pocket of a homeowner. That can make a huge difference in their retirement or help them eliminate debt.

But, if the downside of having a new high-income tax paying resident is that we have to pay some construction workers to build another home for someone to live in then that seems like a good trade-off.

2100,NiceCanadaGoose,britishcolumbia,"Hey man, it's not *me* you have to convince, it's the government. I feel that this is a really sensitive topic for anyone to comment on because in my world, at least, people don't talk about money very openly, and you never know how people are going to react when you talk about *their* money. This is why I tried to be very direct with my advice because I myself know EXACTLY how it feels to be given the completely wrong advice and get your hopes up only to have to face a different reality. I probably should've said that if you're still wanting to go ahead with this process, contact your local CMHA office and they have advocates who work on this exact thing. You will need to be upfront about your medical issues and have a physician not only sign-off the application but also sort of advocate for you in their own language that explains the medical reasons  as to why you need PWD. Furthermore, you're going to have to be upfront about your assets, because that's part of the process too. I was warned of this fact right away with my advocate because she had clients who lied in the past and got caught, basically wasting their time thinking they could hide things from the government/CRA.

I'm very respectful of people who have saved for retirement (I'm glad you've invested well!) but at the same time... my advice is the same. Follow through with it if you want, and as I said CMHA does great work and is super helpful. But because I am going on the information you've provided me with, I said what I said before in my original post and I have to stick to it. I don't have any other information that would tell me otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I've explained my reasoning well and I really hope you get the support you need for whatever it is you're dealing with. I'm really sorry this is happening to you and I hope whatever it is does not become permanent. Almost every single person I've met on PWD themselves has been genuinely pragmatic about their approach to life, including their disability. Permanent conditions without real solutions evolve over time and you have to evolve with it, and oftentimes your world revolves around your disability. It can be hard, man, I know.

&gt; 
&gt; There's no incentive to open more stores, expand business, etc - if you aren't rewarded for it. All it does is create more risk. If you go negative you lose a shit ton of money. If you go positive you gain nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; A million a year sounds like a lot. But for the super wealthy, it really isn't. It's just the beginning of what you can create.

This is where the Conservative fantasy begins. Ok, let's say for a hot minute that we should not put added taxation strain on people over 1,000,000, can you show literally any proof of this ""job creator,"" myth that becomes perpetuated at this point? Can you show literally any proof that additional funds garnered by corporations or private individuals who attain this level of wealth is employed meaningfully, or is there incentive to trickle up the wealth and hoard it? You say that it means no new business, but look at countries where this is already in effect and you'll see that this is absolutely not the case. Runaway capitalism benefits no one, and incentivizes hoarding of wealth. As people become poorer their ability to spend decreases. 

&gt;Yes they are... Have you not looked at the proposals about wealth taxes. Transaction based taxes already exist. For example, sales tax, land transfer taxes, and capital gains taxes. I would favor closing loopholes far more than net new taxes.

How on earth do you think they're proposing a taxation on unrealized wealth? The only method of doing this would be the mark-to-market approach which in of itself would still not touched unrealized gains, but would levy modified taxation on gains which have been sheltered. You can't tax a value that is floating, and non-conservative governments know this. If you do, you would destroy the capacity to save for retirement, which is a hefty No from every government. THis is another lie that the cons parties globally like to push.

I get it man, on paper it looks great. Keep taxes low, push for more open market, less direct payments. I get it, I'm in the top 1% of income earners in this country, but even my earnings wouldn't qualify me for the benefits of shielding taxation over 1m. I don't make anywhere near that.

And that I feel is the real issue here: policy should benefit the largest number of people. No Cons party is pushing this right now, they're pushing the myth of the vaunted job creator, but we do not see that. We see concentration of capital through job elimination. And it's only going to get worse. Efficiency means profit, but it absolutely also means fewer people working (as that tends to be your greatest overhead). Cons aren't looking to the future to see how to fix the onslaught of unemployment that automation will bring, they're looking at how to raid the coffers for today.",guvyrvl,t3_msvaei,1618686792,1618711992.0,/r/ontario/comments/msvaei/kind_of_curious_con_voters_how_are_you_feeling/guvyrvl/,2021-04-17 19:13:12,2021-04

2128,Alpacas_,PEI,"1. People in high income areas becoming untethered to their jobs locations.
2. People retiring early and moving to cheaper far flung areas.
3. Other housing markets being even less affordable.
4. Lumber tripling in price in a year.
5. Air BnB's.
6. Pei being regarded as a covid sanctuary for those tired of lockdowns / risk.
7. Build plans getting rejected (Poorly planned, or NIMBY)
8. People flipping houses they did nothing to for wild gains.
9. Remote work increasing the value of rural areas (that have internet, btw, incoming starlink?)
10. Apartments becoming less desirable due to Pandemic.
11. Long term sustained imaginary interest rates

With this in consideration, really, this isn't surprising. I hear the job market in Toronto has been decimated. Why would you stay there when your job is gone and your house sells for wtf amounts compared to what you paid for it, especially when you see a house in pei that you can overpay for and still pocket the difference as a tidy head start on your retirement?

It's also alarming to hear the number of people who state they can't even afford to buy their house today.

While PEI should do something about it, some of these factors are beyond PEI's scope of responsibility. 

Really, at this point, I'd like to see more action on the federal level regarding this too. Things like Lumber.. This is something that Canada could address in a long term situation. Isn't half our country covered in it?

2159,GrabbinPills,ontario,"K2V is the most suspicious hot spot for sure. It's not historically or currently hot. It apparently doesn't even have high risk LTC/retirement homes, which the minister lied about yesterday?

&gt; Last week, Ontario named three forward sortation areas (FSAs)—the first three digits of a postal code—as hot spots in Ottawa: K1T, K1V, and K2V.

&gt;While K1T and K1V contain several neighbourhoods previously identified by Ottawa Public Health as priority areas for vaccines, none of OPH's priority neighbourhoods are in the K2V FSA.

...

&gt;Elliott told reporters Tuesday that the hot spots areas were originally identified on the basis of historic data.

&gt;""In the case of the Ottawa area (K2V), we're trying to be proactive because we know there are a number of congregate settings there, in terms of retirement homes, long-term care homes, seniors' apartments and so on, where we know we need to get in there before an outbreak happens,"" she said.

&gt;However, there are no long-term care homes or retirement homes in the K2V area. Vaccinations are also complete at all long-term care homes and retirement homes in Ottawa. Second doses for residents were completed in long-term care homes in February and in retirement homes in March.

...

&gt;Data from the non-profit research institute ICES Ontario show that the K2V FSA has seen much lower rates of COVID-19 deaths and infections compared to the other two identified hot spots and some other FSAs in Ottawa that were not named as hot spots.

&gt;K1T had the highest rate of COVID-19 cases at 2.54 cases per 100 population as of April 4. K1V is tied with K1W (Chapel Hill South, Orléans) for third overall in Ottawa at 2.24 cases per 100. K2V is 11th on the list with 1.66 cases per 100.

&gt;When it comes to the rate of hospitalizations and deaths, K2V is much lower on the list at 0.35 hospitalizations/deaths per 1,000. The highest FSA in the city is K1P, in the heart of downtown Ottawa, which has seen 3.95 hospitalizations/deaths per 1,000.

...

&gt;Ottawa South Liberal MPP John Fraser raised the issue in Question Period on Monday, asking how K2V was chosen despite its low rate of transmission.

&gt;""A postal code region in Kanata, a riding of a government minister, is deemed a hot spot, despite lower rates of hospitalization and death than some 300 other neighbourhoods in Ontario,"" he said.

My other Grandmother had a stroke just under a month ago and due to COVID regulations, she was only allowed 1 visitor, twice a week for 2 hours a visit. She wasn't eating except a tiny amount when my mother would go visit - she would show up and the staff say she refused to eat - so she went days without eating. Last week she was declared as being in Palliative care with 2 weeks to live. Because she's now within her last month, she's allowed 2 visitors, 1 at a time, for 2 hours a day. Low-and-behold, when my mom and uncle were now allowed to go daily - she started eating again and getting some exercise. She is now about to be taken off of Palliative care -and will most likely go back down to 1 visitor twice a week until she can be placed in a long-term care facility, we are fully expecting her to take a massive slide backwards.

Older teachers can sometimes get totally fucked over by admin who would rather be working with a group of younger, more pliable staff. I have seen older teachers get given positions they don't want to drive them out of the school or into retirement. I have seen older teachers get given the worst class that is almost stacked against them, again in a way that seems to be trying to make them quit.

If you want to teach ""next to your house"" in the TDSB you have to apply for the job the same way any other candidate does, and you have to interview for it. I know of one teacher in my 13 years who followed our VP to the school where they became Principal, without an interview.

Think of it the other way, dude was a shitty student and now he is the fucking Premiere of Ontario.

Would be very easy to walk away from that and start thinking it validates his opinion that school doesn't actually matter.

In some ways it actually does, it proves who you know and the status you are born into is a far greater advantage in our society than an education alone would be. 

One then only has to look at the large amount (and growing) of highly educated people and their inability to find a job that even pays the bills. That won't stop either, we will continue to produce highly specialized students pushing them into job markets with a low demand. The other won't stop either, incompetent and less than qualified people will always get opportunities they do not deserve simply because of who they know and their status. Marginalizing those who do deserve it but now have less opportunities to achieve it.

I find an anti education or at the very least a devaluation of education has been a growing sentiment for quite some time. I don't see any signs of stopping. Either they get there by being one of the Doug Ford types, or they create them through all the people with thousands in debt while they struggle to pay the bills in a job that can't cover living expenses. Doesn't look good for the future.


**just incase, nothing wrong with going into the trades, that is still in education. But even that isn't the gold mine you get sold on. Certainly there is a lot of money to be made but there also is a lot of competition than you with far more capital and experience. Experience is currency in itself as most don't want the rookie when dealing with construction and when they do it is so they don't have to pay as much as usual. It's also a finite resource because if you don't start your own business with other employees you will be in a bad spot as your body can break down very quickly in that industry and then you are useless to it. Older age and retirement is a very different story from the one a lot of guys become used to in their youth.

2238,ferretgr,newfoundland,"There's a lot of doom and gloom in this thread, as there usually is when people ask this question, but it's really a matter of perspective. On the more positive side of things, I'm in my mid-40s and my family and friends who left for greener pastures back when are all packing their things and moving home from the big cities these days. In the past two years my brother and his family have moved home, and two more close friends have moved home with their families. All of them are overjoyed with their decision. I think the doom and gloom comes from a certain extent from younger people whose employment/income doesn't feel as safe or secure in NL. If you're coming here with an income somewhat guaranteed, as all of those folks did, and you're okay with the slower pace of life, this place can be heaven.

As has been mentioned, if you're into the outdoors, Newfoundland has world class hiking and vast stretches of unexplored, untamed wilderness. If you are into food there's been a real foodie culture happening here (in St. John's, at least) over the past couple of years. It's a safe place to raise kids; I live in the center of the city and I feel very safe. Yes, the weather can be a little unpredictable, but for most of the island, the bitter cold of the winter that you've likely experienced in Ontario is not a thing here. People complain about the rain but bys, it's a bit of rain, it's not going to melt you or anything. 

Personally, I'm secure in my employment and I make a comfortable living for my standards, which would be the only thing that would make me consider leaving, and was the only thing that ever did. I've been lucky enough to have found work here that'll continue until retirement, and you couldn't pay me enough money to leave this place. It's about personal preference and priorities.

2246,changerandom,ontario,"In Canada, public health officers make decisions regarding vaccines schedules.  It's not a political decision.  The roll out is a political decision.   Doug Ford doesn't have the power to set who gets vaccinated in terms of priority.  

Right now vaccine distribution is primarily an issue of supply.  There's not enough vaccine supply to adequately move through the priority levels is a meaningful impactful way.

It's important to remember that vaccine supply issues are entirely a FEDERAL government responsibility.  The provinces have their hands tied.  Now, if you look at BC that decided that were only going to with wider dose separation for 2 dose vaccines to get the 1st dose into more people, well their public health doctors made that call.  But BC also didn't have the retirement home death rate that Ontario and Quebec did either.  The preliminary data on vaccine effectiveness after one dose for the over 75 cohort is muddled.  Most of all the data comes from trial of hospital worker.  So the efficacy of one shot in the over 75yo could be 80% but it also could be 60%.  So the decision about splitting the 2 dose vaccines ends up being a hard choice for Ontario or Quebec.  For BC, the numbers are in their favor, the mortality of only a 60% efficacy in the over 75yo age group will not mean the same mortality rate (cumulative) as it would for Ontario or Quebec.

I don't vote conservative. I don't particularly like Dough Ford.

2264,Turbo_911,ontario,"I always copy and paste this response from BrakemanBob-

I've been in TYE for over 20 years and I have worked out of about 10 different terminals and seen all sorts of ups and downs so I will answer this question as honestly as I can without letting my bad days shine through (and yes, there are bad days). 

First, you have to be a self starter. When the phone rings at 0200 for an 0400 on duty when the lineup predicted you going to work at 1100 and you just got to bed at 2330 and all you want to do is lay back down, you can't. You could lay off but that takes a hit in the wallet and railroads are really cracking down on people calling in sick (only allow you to take 1 day a week off or some other equation). Then once on the train, we don't have a boss watching over us like in an office environment. You could sleep the entire way over the road, until that one time your coworker also falls asleep and you both die in a huge ball of fire. But part of being a self starter is even when you're tired, you stand up. You do jumping jacks in the cab. You engage you coworker in a debate about anything (even if you agree with him). 

Second, will you miss your kids birthdays and Christmas and have to work every weekend? Maybe. Depends. I work for the BNSF and we are allowed 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days a month off. If you lay off 3 weekend days but no weekdays, you're still going to get in trouble for availability. You have to watch your own time (being a self starter). Your boss wont remind you when you're getting close, only bust you once you overstepped your limits. Other railroads have different layoff rules. Some are WAY more strict (and I think the NS is one of them!). 

So let's say you are allowed 2 layoff days a month and your kid's birthday is in December. Do you lay off on your kid's birthday or lay off on Christmas? You're going to either have to miss one of them or work both or layoff both and get in trouble. My kids are 11 and I haven't missed a Christmas yet. I've missed a lot of baseball games and parent teacher conferences, but those are the hard choices you have to make. Could I layoff for all my kids' games and events? Sure, but then I would have to deal with my boss getting in my ass. Pick and choose the days off that are important to you. 

Marriage. ""All railroaders get divorced!"" False. When you meet future Mrs. Fictitious, size her up. Ask yourself, ""If I was stuck on a train during a massive rain storm and the power went out at home and the sump pump started flooding the basement, would Mrs. Fictitious know what to do?"" If the answer is yes, then she can handle your lifestyle. If the answer is no, then it sounds like she needs someone by her side and... she'll find someone, even if you're not there. It takes a lot to be a railroad wife. They are alone just as much as we are. If you try to marry a woman that wants to be treated like a princess and you are there to do it, she will start looking for another prince charming. 

""Holes in your boat"" Some guys think they need all the new fancy toys. New Harley, new crew cab truck, jet ski, boat, etc, etc, etc. And, for the most part, we can either afford it or banks are MORE than happy to give a railroader a loan. But then your kid's birthday comes up or you get sick or you're just burned out and need a day off but you can't. You have too many holes in your boat and you have to keep plugging away. Don't be that guy! And those guys are EVERYWHERE on the railroad! 

Tips? Keep a hobby. Make time for your hobby. There are bad days and bad trips. Don't ONLY be a railroader so you take that crap home with you. Go to work and be a railroader, but when you come home be that dude with the cool hobby or husband your wife missed or dad your kids like having around. Man... I've seen this place eat away at people until their entire mood for the month is set on a trip that happened 20 days ago. When you get in from the trip, wash your hands. Watch all the dirt and grime swirl down the drain. Watch the water get clean. Let it go. 

Exercise! You'll hire on with a 28"" waist and within a year have a 38"" waist. All that railroad retirement won't mean shit if you're clutching your heart at age 59. 

Your social life is important to you.... Man, I'm not going to sugar coat this. Your friends will make plans to go see the Cubs play and ask if you can come. You don't know your schedule so you'll have to bail on them. Then Johnny is having a Halloween party and, ""Dude! Zorn! You're gonna be there, right?"" Pretty soon they'll stop asking. It sucks and I'm not saying this because I'm bitter or angry, I'm being honest. You find any railroader and they will all say the same thing, ""They just stop asking."" 

This is how ""friends"" work on the railroad (one more point then I'll shut up, I promise). I get called. I accept the call. I look and see who I'm working with. I might not know the name. Or I might recognize the name and could probably point him out but never worked with him. Or maybe we've worked together before and even got along. It doesn't matter. Now imagine yourself stuck in a room with another dude for 12 hours. The room is about the size of your bathroom. You each have a chair but you can't leave. Within 5 minutes, you have to make this person your newest bestest friend. Why? I dunno. To make the trip go better? To learn something? To just not feel so damn lonely and you know this guy is in the same shoes as you and will understand? I dunno. But there you are. 12 hours. I've heard some of the funniest stories from these guys, had some of the best conversations, had to endure some of the dumbest bullshit (with a smile on my face), and heard shit you wouldn't even tell your therapist. 12 hours. Then.... its done. Over. You leave the cab and walk away. The ""friendship"" is (for the most part) over. When you see him again, you'll say hi and be cool but he's not going to buy you a Christmas present or call you if you're sick or help you move. Hell, he might not even remember your name... because he is now on another train and now has a new bestest friend. As will you. It kinda fucks us up socially. I can talk to anyone about anything, anywhere and any time. But now in my personal life, I have my family and that's it. The last 2 guys I worked with were totally cool, but I can only remember one of their names. And that's cool, because he probably wont remember my name either. 

So... In conclusion (thank god, huh?).... I've worked some messed up hours and met some messed up people, but in the end it will pay for my kids to go to college, pay for my house for my wife and I to retire in, and I actually kinda like my job.

&gt;“Harris had more than $7 million in Chartwell holdings at the end of 2019 (its last fiscal year) — including $4.29 million in ‘deferred trust units’ (akin to shares) that reflect his accumulated compensation over the years (deferred until retirement).” According to the article, Chartwell’s communications department and a forensic chartered accountant verified these numbers.

&gt;Unifor, a union that represents workers at Chartwell, launched a campaign last year calling for better pay for caregivers in Chartwell’s homes. Unifor’s website states:

&gt;&gt;“Chartwell pays many of their staff minimum wage. In fact, most of their employees do not receive a living wage. To make matters worse, Chartwell has proposed all minimum wage employees have their wages frozen until 2020. These workers provide care and compassion to residents, work that is so important that the Ontario Labour Relations Board has consistently denied them the right to strike, putting them under the same legislation as other essential service providers, such as hospital workers.”

&gt;Katha Fortier, a Unifor spokesperson, said it’s ludicrous the former premier would make more than $200,000 for his part-time job in Chartwell’s corporate boardroom while front-line workers in homes are paid “abysmal, poverty wages.”

&gt;The inability to make a living wage in a home requires many personal support workers to take jobs in multiple seniors’ homes. This, and a lack of personal protective equipment, have been cited as key contributors to the deadly spread of COVID-19.

Private, for profit LTC facilities refused to invest in basic protective equipment and safe staffing. Because they care more about shareholder profits than staff and resident safety. And then many people got sick and died - directly as a result. The stories I've heard from other nurses are indefensible.

2289,SpaceObama,newbrunswickcanada,"It's all a matter of perspective. My folks bought a house in Moncton in 2012. It went down in value after they bought it, took a few years just to even out. I think we're seeing years of missed growth happen really quickly. The 2010s were really slow, basically non-existent, for real estate value to grow. While this is great for first time buyers, it sucks for those who owned a home or got stuck in an underwater mortgage. Nearly two thirds of New Brunswickers own property, so lack of real estate growth hurts the majority of New Brunswickers.

This quick rebound of the real estate value is ruining many people's home ownership plans. I get that, totally. But where do your parent's live? I'm in Moncton, houses have been going for $5k-$10k above asking, maybe $40k above the ""normal"" price. Nothing like where your parents are. I haven't heard of such a jump. Some places, like Campbellton, the prices are actually going down. Houses in my neighborhood are going like crazy, but its leveled off. Most of the houses sold on my street have been to fellow New Brunswickers.

I have to say, again I'm from Moncton, but you can still go 20 or 30 minutes outside the city and find affordable housing. Commuting to work is the norm most places, and a 20 minutes commute is nothing. Saint-Antoine, Memramcook, Sussex are still in the range of Moncton pre-Covid. Good houses in the $100k range. You have grocery and pharmacy and all that in town, and a short drive to Moncton. Maybe this is one of my immigrant things, but I grew up with most things a half hour away. I've found that people here look at you sideways if you commute. One example, my father used to commute from Moncton to Bouctouche for a job. 20 minute drive. People he worked with told him that this job ""wasn't for city people, its for people in the country."" A 20 minute drive! Most places, if you live 20 minutes outside a city, you say you live in that city. But in New Brunswick, you might as well be in a different province. Everyone in New Brunswick owns a car anyways, because public transit is terrible, so we should get over our aversion to a 20 minute commute to work.

You mention it isn't fair to someone making $60k in New Brunswick, that they now can't afford a house. Fair is a relative thing though. Is it fair that retirement-age people all over the country cash out and retire in New Brunswick? They don't contribute meaningfully to the tax revenue, they don't offset the costs they require. Is that fair? They are buying up houses just the same. The only difference, to me, is that younger people are doing this. Younger people who will spend more money in the economy, making the economy grow, and turning that $60k job into an $80k or a $100k job. Part of why it's unfair to the $60k worker is that he is being underpaid.

I don't think there are enough Ontario folk coming here to meaningfully change attitudes here. Many of them specifically don't want to be in Ontario anymore, they want to come here and live the peaceful life that we're known for. Yes, that means cashing out their condo so they can buy land and property. I wouldn't assume they are acting rashly though, its a definite upgrade for them. It's a no brainer for them. You or I would do it if we could.

After a few years, they will all be New Brunswickers. When I immigrated here, the exchange rate was like 1.5x the USD. So I had a huge cash boost coming up here. Was that unfair to New Brunswick? Maybe, but I've been here for over ten years now. I'm going to school to fulfill an identified lack of skilled IT workers in this province. This industry is lacking workers not because of jobs, but because IT workers leave. I plan on staying. I would like to start a tech company here because the internet and land is cheap and there's a HUGE tax credit in the Maritimes...like 50% of employee income. If I'm being honest, I would like to start or be part of a trend of tech companies coming to New Brunswick. We need new ideas to break the status quo here, and that requires new people.

2290,kinokonoko,ontario,"The excess deaths you describe are unfortunate, but there are already laws, health measures, resources, treatments, protocols, supports, etc, etc to address them.  We know what they are, what causes them and how to treat and prevent them.

Healthy people can't choose to not become infected, nor choose to not accidentally infect others.  Healthy people can't choose if the virus will use them as a host for mutation.  

Some healthy people who contract COVID remain ill for months with long-covid symptoms including reduced lung function, blood clotting and chronic pain - all which reduce quality of life, drive up health care costs and reduce worker productivity.

Are you also counting the **reduced** numbers of deaths related to COPD &amp; heart attacks, strokes, reduced burst appendix, motor accident fatalities, etc from the reduction in human activity, and cleaner air?  

Truth is, there has not been a huge uptick in number of deaths world wide when comparing pre-COVID numbers to COVID numbers.

Preventing deaths is not really the purpose of lockdowns.  We have a moral responsibility to do so, and we tack it on as one of the goals, but the real purpose of lockdowns is to protect the economy.

The lockdowns are not the *cause* of the deaths and harm --- this living and replicating virus is the cause.   The psychological and social effects should not be separated from the physical symptoms.   

New Zealand locked down hard and fast, and they have the benefit of being an island nation that could shut down it's borders.  [They are mostly back to normal now.](https://www.newstalk.com/news/new-zealanders-happy-with-strict-border-controls-in-return-for-normal-life-former-pm-1140882)

The east coast of Canada almost followed the same path, but they were too quick to open, and look at them now.

Sadly, the toxic politicization of COVID measures in the US spilled over to us in Ontario, and we were (and still are) confused and conflicted about how to respond, and we are unable to stop border crossers without tanking our economy completely.  

Unfortunately, the cost of living in a democracy is that we weren't able to track, arrest and imprison the infected like they do in Singapore and China, places where their economies are back up and running.

&gt;Ultimately, both locking people down and not locking people down are going to lead to loss of life.

Yes, but the difference is that lockdowns give us a way to throttle the spread so that the healthcare system doesn't become overwhelmed - remember it's not just beds, but equipment, nurses, doctors, cleaners, food service people - who have to work longer and longer hours while their numbers are also reducing from COVID infections or just plain burnout retirement.

Having no lockdown means we just let it run rampant - just like Brazil which is suffering both a crisis in healthcare, preventable deaths, human antibody resistant mutations, and economic collapse from the chaos.

It should be noted here that countries that [have contained the virus also tend to have had less severe economic impacts than those that haven’t.](https://theconversation.com/data-from-45-countries-show-containing-covid-vs-saving-the-economy-is-a-false-dichotomy-150533).

You ask what would change my mind?  Well, if Brazil turned out just fine, then I'd have to say that lockdowns are not worth it.   You might say that a developing country like Brazil doesn't compare to us, but then again, how is India doing so well with it's sprawling slums and poverty?
If Sweden's approach of protecting the vulnerable and taking reasonable distancing measures worked, I would have said that lockdowns are unneccessary, but [even though it seemed like they were going to be ok, the virus caught up to them anyway.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientist-behind-swedens-no-lockdown-policy-says-it-wasnt-strict-enough-11591196353)",gsqtvdy,t3_mfnwpb,1617061327,1617086527.0,/r/ontario/comments/mfnwpb/number_of_youth_in_hospital_after_suicide_attempt/gsqtvdy/,2021-03-29 23:42:07,2021-03

Why can't we go somewhere in the middle?

You say hundreds of Ontario people moving to New Brunswick is too fast. You know the population of New Brunswick is 776k, right? How slowly do you think people should be coming here? As it is, it's still slow. And we have years of lost time to make up for.

You're judging the world through rose-colored New Brunswick glasses. People in other regions/countries spend time with their kids, have barbeques and parties, all the rest. That's not unique to New Brunswick.

You complain about people coming with fat bank accounts, but isn't that what retirement age people do already? Wouldn't it be better to have young people with money come in, spend that money in the local economy that employs locals? Instead of a retired person who doesn't go out, doesn't go to restaurants or music venues or art exhibits? As it is, the whole country comes here to retire so they can take advantage of their fat bank account. Might as well the local economy gets some advantage and use of that money, than sitting in a bank account. 

I find your last paragraph disturbing. You would really rather let this province burn, just so you can have a bigger share of the ashes? Your attitude is selfish and self-defeating.

2295,SpaceObama,newbrunswickcanada,"You can't fully appreciate how deeply-ingrained the attitudes are here, until you move here. You don't get a taste of that from just visiting. Every place positions themselves as family-friendly, good for work/life balance, etc... It's hard to judge this especially when the government, a Conservative government mind you, is going around the country advertising for people to move here. The message from the government has always been, and always be, ""we want more workers!"". For the longevity and survival of this province, we **need** more young workers in this province.

When I came here, I was initially excited by the more relaxed attitudes. But after a few years, it's just way too relaxed for me. I shouldn't get shit for wanting to go back to school for a career. I see real downsides and disadvantages that I would have never imagined before living here.

Some people here, maybe most, would be just happy to leave this as a retirement community. But that isn't sustainable. It literally can't stay that way forever. There just isn't enough industry jobs (wood industry, oil industry, etc) to sustain the population here. Something has to budge. Either services get cut down to nothing, or we incentivize new workers and new businesses to come into the province. The birth rate here is not enough to cover the difference. Something has to change.

I also don't see this province the same way you do now. I see a province under the thumb of one controlling family. Quality of life is determined by their payrolls. This province needs more competition, and it needs it yesterday. It kills me to see people just accept the fate that the Irving family has given them. I see a province with potential to really shine, to really grow. The government has to work against the stereotypes and real attitudes of their own people just to get enough business to stay afloat. Even when convinced to come here, they all leave because they can't find skilled workers. Skilled workers born and raised in New Brunswick leave as soon as possible. That's no good, wouldn't you agree?

This is backed up by the [COVID-19 vaccination stats by age for Ontario](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/) published by the Federal government.

&gt;*""as of today we have ~5 million people vaccinated. That's 13% of our ENTIRE population.'*

Are you looking at Federal stats? As of yesterday Ontario had administered[ 1,916,332 doses.](https://twitter.com/celliottability/status/1375813275477233664?s=20)

A lot of seniors are still waiting for their first appointment or lingering on wait lists to even *get* an appointment. And when they *are* finally vaccinated it takes another ~2 weeks for immunity to develop.

My community has pretty detailed [COVID-19 vaccination stats,](https://www.kflaph.ca/en/healthy-living/status-of-cases-in-kfla.aspx) and we were part of the pharmacy vaccination pilot program for seniors, so we have have higher vaccination rates than the average.

2308,agnchls,ontario,"I appreciate your thought out response, but I just don't agree with you about these types of jobs not being enough to provide a living wage, saving for retirement and putting away money. Painting, Dog walking are not so physical that they cannot be done weekly for long periods of time. And they do pay well. In the globe and mail they interviewed a dog walker as part of their expose on salaries and the individual was making 80k per year. That's livable. 

I mentioned education, but education does not equal University. It can be, but education is skill building and can be done at a trades school, collage, apprentice etc. As a society, we desperately need to get off this mindset of more University degree is always better. We need a skilled society. We don't need more BA's. We shouldn't even be encouraging that. If tuition is too expensive then choose another route. There are just so many opportunities out there, it's staggering.

I'd like to think I've seen broadened my world view enough, but it hasn't changed my outlook and actually cemented my view as a Canadian Conservative vs the other options. I do believe in balanced budgets (except in recession). I do believe that money and resources are finite and continual spending beyond your means is unsustainable. I do believe that you have a right to a significant share of your earnings (Note: not all, as you success is a product of you and your environment). I do believe having a safety net is important, but there are limits to all of that. I also believe in personal responsibility. You need to own your failures and your success.  That said, I do have an MBA, Economics Undergrad, travelled to 50+ countries (all self funded of course [yes, I realize I have had my education subsidized by tax payers]) and associated with people from poverty to decently wealthy people. I've met those who have been helped by the system and I've met many who have taken advantage of the system. I've read the articles that show a more equal society is beneficial, but I've also seen empirically how it can be stifling. For better or for worse the US is still a driving force in innovation in the world, while Europe lags. A part of this is the stifling labor laws that prevent dynamism. I'm arguing on degrees. I'm further arguing that even more increased taxation is not the answer. The reality is, I would never vote for an NDP government as they do not represent my values. At their core, their message is that government is the solution to all of your ills. University too expensive, the government helps. Your job not paying you enough, the government will mandate increases to your outcome. Your phone bills too high, well the government will mandate decreases. It's a party of victimhood and reliance on government. A physically conservative liberal is something I could vote for depending on the election. That said as Liberals drift further left, that seems unlikely in the near future.

Once again, appreciate your response. We don't see eye to eye and that's ok. Maybe many of those you know who are conservatives changed their mind, but look around.

But it really doesn't matter what our government does, if the US raises interest rates we will have to follow. Given that they've printed 40+ cents for every dollar in a single year, the only way to avoid hyperinflation (other than printing even more money and continuing to buy US bonds which is just perpetuating the problem) is to raise interest rates. 

If I was Biden I wouldn't raise interest rates until I get relected (or its clear I wouldn't be). People going bankrupt is problably not going to get me relected.

He's talking about making university free if your parents make less than 125,000, and raising minimum wage to $15 which will be the ultimate nail in the coffin for businesses who are already struggling. A $15 minimum wage is insane in the US. Here in Ontario we have the highest minimum wage in the country at $14...they want $15 and their dollar is worth 20-25% more than ours so its more like $18-20 Canadian. That may sounds reasonble in California, or New York. But imagine being a small business barely hanging by a thread in a small state like North Dakota and the government with a flip of a switch is making you pay more than double ($7.25 atm) to your minimum wage workers while you are already shutdown. 

These people are done. The reason I bring all this up, is because the trade with the US comprises 40% of our entire GDP (700 billion).

CTV has an article saying that half of covid deaths are from people 85 and older.  I don't even know someone 85 years old, so tell me why the hell I, a guy in his 20s, needs to be in a lockdown? The way I see it, make the CERB more generous, and give it to people who are elderly and who have underlying conditions. **You** people stay home as **you** are the ones susceptible to the virus. 

The way it seems is, boomers and other people who are susceptible to the disease, don't want to be locked down while everyone else is living their lives, so they want us all to suffer. What other argument is there? They're rationing out the vaccine oldest to youngest, so they know damn well young people and kids are fine. 

If you don't feel safe, don't go outside.

I’ll break out some numbers below:

Everyone making over 59k is contributing the max to CPP ($2898). Employer matches for a total of $5800. If we were to assume a 40 year career and a rate of return of 5% (conservative estimate), you could expect to have $700k upon retirement if you invested on your own. At a safe withdrawal rate of 4%, you could take out $28k/year. If you use a 6% rate of return, you could have $36k/year. So $28-36k is a good expected range. The maximum CPP pays out is $14500, and very few people get that. The average CPP payout is only $7350.

Even if we assumed that the UCP fucked the dog and only got a 3% arr (far worse than the 30 year period following the 1929 top), you could expect $17.5k/yr.

If the average teacher retires at 55 (although most work beyond that age) and they receive a pension that is 60% of their previous salary (so $60,000 before taxes and thus roughly $45,000 take home pay per year) and they are paid that until the age of 82 (average life expectancy in Canada) that would be 27 years x $45,000 = $1,215,000. Anyone who had invested $450,000 wisely over a 30 year period should be able to accumulate $1,215,000 in their retirement savings.

Doug Ford and Trudeau are both rich kids that are politically removed from those who came up in middle class families. 50% of millennials that own homes admit to having their parents make the downpayment. If we're anything like the states, millennials probably own 5ish percent of wealth, but what we do know about Canada is the top 10% of millennials hold more than 50% of that wealth. 

Our heighten immigration is even a byproduct of it. ""Immigrants are known to raise the GDP"", but right now our GDP is mostly based on a FIRE sector that will collapse once central banks raise interest rates, a resource economy that is subject to international fights between countries like Russia and OPEC, and a manufacturing sector that's increasingly being automated out and outsourced. So that argument is bullshit. The next one is ""we need to replace Canadians to pay for social services because Canadians aren't having children"" we aren't having children because many of us are in poverty. Then there's we don't start businesses, again we don't have money. So our immigration is based on eroding class mobility. The last is argument is ""we need more professionals"" yet we're suffering from mass amount of STEM brain drain to the states because we won't increase wages, and the bulk of our professionals are being consolidated into the FIRE sector that will crash.

Then there's straight up wealth protectionism. There's been multiple times through out the decade where interest rate should've been raised yet there's been political pressure from federal governments not to do so because it would fuck over the generations that's retirement is based on the price of their house.

Couple that with the debt our governments at every level have created and you should start worrying now. Because the price is paid with your ass when the services you’re funding (but not using) completely fall apart from a lack of a tax base.

The problem is we are treating our HOMES as investment vehicles more than a place where we can raise our family.

2406,DrOctopusMD,ontario,"There are demographic reasons for this. Ever since the start of the industrial revolution, birthrates in western countries have been in consistent long-term decline.

*Except* for the Baby Boom post WWII! When our current social programs (like healthcare, CPP, etc.) were set up post WWII, there were far more working people relative to older people, so there was more than enough funding to go around. E.g. you'd have 3-4 working people for every retired person. Not an exact number, just an example.

But birthrates started declining again in the 1960s (for a variety of reasons). And the Baby Boomers are going to be living a lot longer than their predecessors.

So, you have an atypical burst in population, which means there are fewer younger people relative to the older people that need support (maybe 2-3 working people per retired person), plus that cohort is living longer.

When our universal healthcare system was first set up in the 1960s, life expectancy was around 70-71. So the average retirement period was like 5-6 years. Life expectancy is now well over 80. So that triples the retirement period people where people are drawing on the system more than contributing to it (generally).

To sum up, *we've gone from a period where 3-4 working people would have to financially support one retired person for 5ish years, to 2-3 working people having to support one retired person for 15 years.* You can see the financial problem. Again, these are not exact figures at all, just to give an example.

So, the basic formula needs rebalancing. There are three ways to do it:

**1. Younger people need to have a LOT more kids.** That's probably not realistic, and despite many claims that people are having fewer kids because they can't afford the cost of living, the historical reason is actually the opposite: as people (particularly women) get more economically secure, they have fewer kids and have them later.

**2. MASSIVE cuts to services and/or LARGE tax hikes.** This would be a short term solution at best, as doing these things without impacting economic growth would be highly difficult. Plus, politically they'd be near impossible for any government to do without immediately getting turfed.

**3. Increase immigration.** The type of immigrants we let in are generally much younger than the population as a whole. They are also typically of the age where they have or will have kids too. So this is a way to balance those demographics.

It's worth nothing that it's possible that we get to a more stable demographic situation once the baby boomers die off (don't mean to be callous, just stating it as a fact) and we can entertain lower levels of immigration. But the youngest boomers are jusssst hitting retirement age now, so we realistically have another 15-20 years until that starts to play out.",gougd1k,t3_lt0qzs,1614357774,1614382974.0,/r/ontario/comments/lt0qzs/why_does_the_government_allow_for_so_much/gougd1k/,2021-02-26 16:42:54,2021-02

Two, it's not disaggregated across different classifications of RE. It's highly concentrated in the condo market, within a few metro areas. 

Three, Canadians who own condos largely fall in two broad categories - investors, and young people. Investors who maybe found themselves sitting on more cash than they ever thought they'd have (might be your blue collar mom/pop, might be your bank exec), and young people who could only afford to purchase condos. 

If you were to create a rule against ownership and force divestment - what would be the 'or else', in effect the threat? Expropriation? Penalties? If it's expropriation than by law all those sales go at market value anyways, so it does fuck all to the market. 

If you force sales of 5% of condos roughly on the market at one time, you potentially cause a panic. If there's fire selling of condos, you very well might destroy the home equity of young condo owners, and boomers looking to liquidate their homes and use that equity for retirement.

2444,duckface08,ontario,"A few reasons why we're vaccinating the elderly first:

1) There is the chance that the COVID vaccines does not prevent the shedding of the virus. It merely prevents you from getting seriously ill from COVID. This means that you could be asymptomatic but still spread it to others. This is why they are recommending that people still wear masks, even if they're vaccinated.

2) Statistically, young people are far less likely to get seriously ill from COVID. The majority of deaths in the province are seniors, especially the elderly who live in retirement or nursing homes. The majority of hospitalized COVID patients are older, as well, meaning this population is far more likely to overwhelm the health care system than young people.

3) Old people still go out. They still interact with others. Many are actually dependent on care providers (either from within their families or professional caregivers/health care workers) to get by.

4) Many elderly live in retirement homes or nursing homes. Living in the same home and interacting with the same people every day is an easy way for the virus to spread. Passing by someone in the grocery store once is highly unlikely to transit the virus, especially if people are wearing masks.

Considering the above, it makes sense to vaccinate the elderly first. We want to prevent them from getting seriously ill so they A) don't die from COVID, and B) don't overwhelm the health care system. Vaccinating young people first makes no sense because, as I said, statistically, they are far less likely to die from it or be hospitalized.",go85qok,t3_lonu1x,1613915857,1613941057.0,/r/ontario/comments/lonu1x/recently_released_covid_19_vaccination/go85qok/,2021-02-21 13:57:37,2021-02

I did not realize the importance of using sources for something like this as my intent was just to express my opinions on these matters. From now on I will try to find some articles whenever I post my opinions here, and here are some sources for this claim as requested:

&gt;Some residents have been socially isolated for over 3 months due to  COVID‐19 outbreaks, spending all day and every meal trapped alone in  their rooms; held hostage by ill‐conceived policies (Bercovici, [2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jan.14467#jan14467-bib-0006)). Such policies are out of touch with the needs of residents and are causing emotional distress.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;While correlation does not indicate causation, the relationship between  social isolation and medical illness suggests that the dangers of social  isolation pose a significant counterweight to the threat of COVID‐19.  Our society must confront the toll and trauma that COVID‐19  countermeasures have taken on older adults residing in LTC facilities  and their families.   
&gt;  
&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jan.14467](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jan.14467)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In a pandemic environment of social lockdown, older people may be  especially vulnerable to suicide through a heightened sense of  disconnectedness from society, physical distancing, and loss of usual  social opportunities, as well as greater risk of anxiety and depression  (Santini *et al.*, [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235297/#r30)). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235297/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235297/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[In China\] the authors found that 53.8% of 1210 respondents rated the psychological  impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, 16.5% reported moderate  to severe depressive symptoms and 28.8% reported moderate to severe  anxiety symptoms. Qiu *et al*.7  performed a countrywide survey that included 52 730 people in China  during the COVID-19 epidemic and found that about 35% of the  participants had psychological distress. This is consistent with the  results of a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey indicating that 45%  of adults in the USA report that their mental health has been negatively  impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus.

When I grew up here I didn't really see the NL mentality for what it is.  Since I've retired &amp; moved home ... it floors me.

A buddy gave me an interesting stat.  For every dollar we pay into the E.I. program, we take 5 out.

Personally, I've drawn E.I. once.  That was around 25 yrs ago.  And when I was drawing   it, I made the choice to change track.

Yet I'm literally surrounded by people who have made E.I. a way of life.  I call it the NL retirement - work as little as possible and then live off the gov't teat.  It's fucking embarrassing.

What's even worse is how we blatantly refuse any practical solutions or new ideas, thinking we know best.  Here's a hint - we don't.  And those of us who are willing to objectively asses the situation and try new solutions are marginalized.

&gt; A whistleblower at a Courtice retirement home says management removed the door handles on rooms of COVID-19 positive residents, &amp;quot;Trapping&amp;quot; them in their suites for days in a bid to halt the spread of the deadly virus.

&gt; The employee, who wished to remain anonymous, tells CityNews that a manager at the White Cliffe Terrace Retirement Residence ordered maintenance staff to remove door handles on some fourth-floor assisted living suites last week.

&gt; The employee says affected residents still had access to food and were checked on by staff who tried to work around the lack of door handles.

Aside from the paperwork hassle, filing with the IRS also means that investments you make in the country where you live are considered to be foreign investments, not covered by tax treaties, and those dividends taxed at high rates and requiring yet more IRS forms. In Canada, US citizens can use Canadian retirement options without that penalty (equivalents to IRAs), but beyond that we're pretty much stuck with standard savings accounts - no ETFs or mutual funds.

Every instance of UBI test programs have shown that introducing a UBI didn't result in a lower employment rate. In fact, it actually lead to more parents entering the workforce because the UBI covered the cost of childcare. You had more people going back to school to earn degrees, which lead to more people in higher paying jobs. You had more people opening their own businesses.

UBI heavily benefitted young people starting out on their own, elderly people who had reached retirement age, new parents, entrepreneurs, students, and the overall economy. It benefits everyone to some extent. 

The difference with a UBI is that it doesn't penalize people for working like our current welfare program does, which means people keep working so that they can have *more* money. Currently, if you make more than $200 a month, welfare starts sending you less money. If you make more than $1,000 a month, you get kicked off of welfare, which means you also lose your bus pass, and subsidized childcare which you wouldn't be able to afford to pay for yourself if you're only making $1,000-$1,500 a month. It means there is an incentive not to work with welfare that isn't there with a UBI. 

New brunswick would benefit greatly from an increase in entrepreneurs. A UBI could provide that for us.

2575,RedGriffyn,ontario,"You didn't read the studies did you? 

AstraZeneca: ""Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years).""  So this very low sample size study specifically excluded unhealthy individuals &gt;65 years of age.  So nothing in their trial deals with the systemic bias in the LTC population of folks who have multiple severe comorbidities and imparied immune systems as compared to the normal &gt;65 year old population.  FYI its not usual that 'healthy' people go to LTC for medical supervision wherein they could have gone to a retirement home and still remained self sufficient.  There is literally a warning on the summary website you sent for this study warning against this exact misrepresentation of the data.

Pfizer: ""Adults 16 years of age or older who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection, were eligible for participation in the trial. Key exclusion criteria included a medical history of Covid-19, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an immunocompromising condition."" That is a little better protocol for population inclusion, but still doesn't fully address that LTC has a strong bias of immuno compromised individuals.""

Moderna: Go look at the protocol exclusion list on page 24-26 [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2028436/suppl_file/nejmoa2028436_protocol.pdf).  It is pretty extensive and open ended and again excludes lots of different co-morbidities/poor immuno responses present in LTC populations.

Casino: Again only selected ""healthy"" adults.  Same critique as above.

At the end of the day the current studies don't address the population make-up in LTCs (likely because it is unethical throw immuno compromised persons to the wolves and because it will make their results worse when they are trying to be first to market and sell their product).

LTCs have two primary vectors: healthcare workers and family.  

The first group is essential and must be there.  Currently in the LTC staff around me they undergo weekly Covid-19 testing, are mandated to follow proper PPE protocols, and are forced to cohort/use other administrative protocols upon outbreak.  However, this population group still has to shop, see children, take care of their own vulnerable who aren't in LTCs, etc.  Not only are they a vector to LTC they are as big a community spread vector as any other normal person.

The second group is non-essential.  To be allowed into a LTC members have to also have recent negative test results and wear PPE.  However the truth is that family members frequently lie about test results and are in frequent violation of PPE requirements.  These are the same POAs who will rationalize flying abroad, not quarantining for 2 weeks, going to see their parent in care, and cause the outbreak.  The LTCs are afraid of addressing non-compliance in families because of the ridiculous power POAs have in the system (not true for staff despite having powerful unions).  At least if the government was to make visiting not allowed (like during the first wave when we had much greater success) it gives the LTC facilities the ammunition they need to avoid costly pointless legal challenges/vindictive reporting from families.

An engineered control (mandated for staff) for one vector, administrative control for the other vector, and continued testing of the LTC patients/working staff populations to ensure any 'through the cracks vectors from those where the vaccine is not effective' are still caught and addressed as quickly as reasonable.  Assuming that the virus is in active outbreak at every facility already is nonsensical when you can actively remove remove credible means of spread of the disease to the facility.

I have had at least four separate family members in LTC in the last 5 years who are all now passed.  But from the way you are only concerned about patients and not actual health outcomes/practices means that I can tell you don't have any family members who work in LTCs.  Clearly you view on infection control practice is naive and without personal appreciation of the rationale behind why the best use of limited vaccine supplies should go to the population who is the biggest vector as they are community spread/LTC vectors.",gkeg2om,t3_l2e8a1,1611419640,1611444840.0,/r/ontario/comments/l2e8a1/ontario_could_prevent_hundreds_of_deaths_if_all/gkeg2om/,2021-01-23 16:34:00,2021-01

2589,GrabbinPills,ontario,"Excerpts from this piece mixed with some previous comments from the author,.

&gt; Historically, most long-term care homes in Ontario were independently owned, often by a single individual or family. The explosion of big chains over the past several decades was aided by the competitive bidding process implemented by Premier Mike Harris’ government in the 1990s. 

&gt; This saw two-thirds of the 20,000 new long-term care beds awarded to for-profit chains, three of which evolved into the financialized corporations that now dominate the market (Sienna Senior Living, Revera and Extendicare). Harris is currently chair of the board at Chartwell, a part-time position that nets him $237,000 per year.

&gt; In Ontario, residents pay for room and board while the province covers care-related expenses at all homes, regardless of ownership type. Financialized long-term care companies rely on this funding, as well as construction subsidies for new development.

&gt; They receive additional public support in the form of mortgage insurance from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which adds to the socialization of risk and privatization of rewards embedded in the sector.

&gt; Fees for room and board are set by the province, so long-term care companies cannot make money by increasing their rates. As a result, they have to generate profits by cutting costs. For-profit chains, many of which are financialized, provide fewer hours of direct care per resident than other ownership types.

...

&gt; These companies are also engaged in ancillary businesses, including retirement residences, home care services and management and consulting, allowing them to earn more money for shareholders while expanding their influence in the sector. Scarborough’s Tendercare Living Centre, for example, which experienced the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the province, had contracted out its management to Extendicare.

...

&gt; [[The author of this research, Jackie Brown], analyzed](https://twitter.com/jackiebrownTO/status/1343649065834311686?s=19) COVID-19 mortality rates in Ontario’s LTC homes from January 15-July 14, 2020. As this figure indicates, financialized homes had far and away the highest death rate (1.55 times greater than even other for-profit homes)

&gt; Their mandate is to generate returns for investors, and they’ll do whatever it takes to squeeze out profits: rent hikes, renovictions, etc. But REITs [Real estate investment trusts] are spreading into other areas of real estate besides housing: retail, farmland, data centres, and LTC

&gt; In LTC homes, private equity firms and REITs are balancing two entirely incompatible objectives: maximizing shareholder returns and providing quality care to elderly residents

&gt; I classified five companies as financialized. Of these, three are REITs publicly traded on the TSX and were the focus of the @TorontoStar investigation: Chartwell, Extendicare, and Sienna Senior Living

&gt; REITs offer investors a liquid, tax-efficient piece of the real estate market without the responsibilities of direct ownership. Shares are easily bought and sold, accelerating the timescale for profit

&gt; Investors evaluate these corps according to factors like growth, profits, and risk. This means that an LTC company can be directly compared to a chain of hotels or office buildings, for example",gk43ljj,t3_l29kmc,1611269176,1611294376.0,/r/ontario/comments/l29kmc/the_dangers_of_financialized_longterm_care/gk43ljj/,2021-01-21 22:46:16,2021-01

ARTICLE: 

Ontario is adding mental health beds in 16 hospitals to cope with increased demand and will increase funding for a seniors’ help line as pandemic lockdowns continue under the state of emergency and stay-at-home orders.

The 46 new beds amount to an increase of just under one per cent of the approximately 4,700 already available for adults.

“These beds will support patients living with mental-health challenges as well as individuals who are experiencing a mental-health crisis that requires treatment and care that is more appropriately provided in a hospital setting,” Michael Tibollo, associate minister of mental health and addictions, told a news conference Thursday.

“Increased periods of social isolation coupled with the uncertainty of the times have created added pressure which can be difficult for people to handle.”

The new beds account for most of the $12 million set aside for the expansions in mental health services, which include $130,000 for the Seniors Safety Line to hire and train more operators to meet higher volumes of calls to their toll-free number 1-866-299-1011.

Seniors Safety Line helps people experiencing physical, emotional or financial abuse and neglect and encourages any seniors in these situations to reach out to a trusted friend, relative or medical professional.

Tibollo said lockdowns are hard on mental health but have been necessary to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, which computer modelling recently warned could monopolize intensive care beds needed for car accident victims, heart patients and others requiring emergency surgery.

“That’s the way we have to handle this. There are no other options.”

Baycrest Hospital is getting up to $1.1 million from the government to improve service at its behavioural neurology unit, which has 20 beds and works with seniors who have dementia and significant symptoms.

As well, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is being provided with $164,000 to improve training for staff who work with residents of nursing homes and retirement homes.

That money will help staff “increase their understanding of the mental health challenges and unique needs of older adults,” the government said.

A report from the Ontario government’s science table of doctors, epidemiologists and others advising Premier Doug Ford said Wednesday that the pandemic has seen increased use of “psychotropic drugs” on nursing-home residents.

**The report also found that many residents are experiencing cognitive declines that will be difficult to reverse.**",gk3sz8b,t3_l284dv,1611264192,1611289392.0,/r/ontario/comments/l284dv/ontario_adding_mental_health_beds_in_16_hospitals/gk3sz8b/,2021-01-21 21:23:12,2021-01

Yes, you can bank an amount of sick leave to roll over (to a maximum), but the only thing that gets paid out is vacation leave (which can also roll over to a maximum amount). I'm also pretty sure that there is a limit on how much vacation leave can be paid out, therefore if you're over that limit, you will be made to take vacation to get it under the limit.

2624,Astroghet,britishcolumbia,"Man, tree planting provided me with some of the coolest things in my life. One scene I'll never forget (my God it gives me chills thinking about it again.) 

Planting in Manitoba, in a corner day-piece filled with sphagnum on a long beautiful day. Not too hot, not too cold, with the odd small cloud to remind you to look up every once n a while and take it in. The sun is on its way out, not far from the horizon and my crew boss is walking and talking nonsense with me while I plant. His dog barks at the tree line and breaks our conversation, only for us to see a big stud elk with a full rack slowly move into the back of my piece from our south, heading west toward the sunset. He looks at us, stands his ground until we quiet the dog, and greet this majestic beast with stillness and silence. His family follows close behind and as we sit in silence and watch, one cloud directly above us begins to sprinkle lightly. With the sun beaming at half power seemingly only an inch from the horizon, this family of elk crest the small, nearby hill directly infront of the sun, for a silhouette of the pure beauty nature has to offer. The rain tingles my skin for one final moment, the beasts continue on, and the sunlight fades.

The subject of my planting retirement previously discussed earlier in the day, my boss finally breaks the silence:

""... and you want to leave this behind.""

It wasn't that that I wanted to leave behind. I shit you not though, this happened and I have fully accepted that I will never experience such majesty in the truest definition of the word again in my life.

Never take anything for granted and soak everything in while you're there.

I question why anyone would opt to pull Alan Beddoe’s flag ""The Pearson Pennant"" out of retirement as a base for Ontario symbolism when it lost national approval and was derided in the media and was perceived by some as a concession to Quebec.

[https://historicalmusingssite.wordpress.com/tag/pearson-pennant/](https://historicalmusingssite.wordpress.com/tag/pearson-pennant/)

The blue on the left and right of Beddoe's flag represented Canada’s military strength from sea to sea. Our province isn't bordered by seas so why two of them?

I question the absence of Ontario’s official provincial flower, the trillium.  Trying to turn 3 leaves into a trillium instead of just using a trillium is more fitting a symbol of bloated bureaucracy and government inefficiency then what is being rationalized in the accompanying copy.

I also question the complete absence of the color green found in the province's coat of arms and tartan that represent our forests and fields.

Instead of seeking feedback of this design in a vacuum I suggest viewing it in context to other designs that have been advanced, like Green Ensin is designed by a resident from London, Ontario

2629,FizixMan,ontario,"And before they die of COVID, they take up precious hospital/ICU space. Vaccinating them helps alleviate that pressure.

From what I understand, the LTC outbreaks are affecting people disproportionately to those living independently or with family. And those living independently (generally) have options for isolating or mitigating exposure risks while those in congregate living don't. So with what few vaccines we have _at the moment_ we can get the biggest ""bang for our buck"" (so to speak) by vaccinating the relatively smaller LTC population to minimize the number of them that have to go to hospital.

Furthermore, vaccines help, but one of the biggest things they need is herd immunity to minimize _exposure_ to the virus. Because a LTC home is (generally) a relatively isolated island of people, it's actually possible to get herd immunity within those settings. Meanwhile, elderly persons living independently are a much, much bigger pool of people and there is no possibility of having any level of herd immunity for them with the vaccine supplies we have available.

By reducing hospital pressure, it means that it's more likely that your mom or inlaws (or anyone else) needing COVID-unrelated hospital care or access to surgeries are able to do so.

Plus, on top of that, taking your argument that we shouldn't waste vaccines on the unhealthy in LTC, there are _many_ people in LTC/retirement homes that are relatively healthy, have a decent quality of life, and not expected to die in the foreseeable/near future. If the other residents/staff aren't vaccinated, it's more dangerous for them as they are in a much more precarious position with outbreaks occurring on their own floor.",gjq3i4r,t3_kzvon7,1610982035,1611007235.0,/r/ontario/comments/kzvon7/unpopular_opinion_vaccine_rollout_should_ot_focus/gjq3i4r/,2021-01-18 15:00:35,2021-01

I’m only speaking of the people around me but a lot of the 60+ I’ve been around/talked with during the pandemic haven’t taken this as seriously as my group in their 35-45 years range. I know some as soon as they get the vaccine they are travelling(mostly to Florida as long as it’s before June).

But away from socialization/being more creative with exercise being held up has little impact on them financially or any other major stresses away from the general isolation.

I feel a priority should be people in secondary line locations like teachers, food industry(factories, restaurants, food supply chain.) somewhat mandatory areas where there is higher risk.

2632,ROVpilot101,ontario,"I agree completely.  I’m not passing a specific judgement here.  I admittedly did not attend any protests this year.  There are a lot of interesting arguments about the lockdown to consider.  As a society we need to balance the obvious visibility of preventable COVID deaths against a utilitarian calculus of less tangible and multimodal societal harm from the restrictions.  Perhaps the lock down would seem like less of a political move to appear to take action if there were stricter rules including large corporate businesses and specific measures were put in place to alleviate the harm by perhaps reinstating CERB, providing wage subsidies for small businesses, enacting a stay on rent and mortgage payments, postponing evictions, etc.  These overtly socialist actions fly ideologically in the face of what the conservative and liberal governments stand for and would force us to confront and challenge the inequalities in the neoliberal economic system that has become canonical in western society.  We don’t see policy makers who are willing to do this.  On the other hand, there is a threshold of burden on the healthcare system that when passed affects far more than just individuals with COVID.  My own mother had vital ocular injections for macular degeneration postponed during the first wave which has lead to a significant and permanent loss of vision.  As another example, elective surgeries include many cardiac surgeries that are necessary for survival but not acutely enough to risk carrying out during a hospital outbreak.  Individuals who have been assessed as needing cardiac bypass have to live incredibly sedentary lives to minimize the risk of an ischemic attack and some will succumb to heart attacks while waiting for surgery.  These effects also need to be factored into the calculus.  Keeping the caseload low prevents many of these ancillary effects.  Furthermore, community spread of COVID creates a disproportionate amount of harm to the elderly, arguably one of the most vulnerable groups of people in our society.  Is it appropriate for this group to bear the brunt of the burden, or should deleterious effects of the pandemic be more equitably distributed trough lockdown restrictions?  I’m not saying I have an answer to any of these questions.  I’m not a public health expert with a team of statisticians and researchers, just a microbiologist currently employed in the marketing department of a robotics firm.  I just want to point out that the solution is complicated and nuanced and will never be perfect.  In my view, the rhetoric of anti-mask and pro-freedom activists undermines the nuanced and collaborative discussions we need to be having, and are indicative of the general lack of political agency any of us feel on either side of any of these issues.

Philosophizing aside, I stand my by argument that specifically advocating against masks is more *directly* harmful than attempting to raise awareness about asymmetrical violence perpetrated by police against the black population.  This is an easy calculus to make politically even if not stated explicitly and (of course I am speculating) may have informed the decision to carry out these arrests.

Ultimately, if the protesters were following public health statutes - wearing masks and keeping their distance It would give me greater pause to consider yesterday’s arrests in a more negative light.  To the best of my knowledge, public health statues do prohibit gatherings of this size; this protest is by definition illegal.  I am not rejecting the idea that similar statues were  ignored in the BLM marches during the first wave, I’m just suggesting that optics are a contributing factor.  If a BLM protest was broken up for violating health statutes, considering my personal moral and logical framework I would accept the dispersion of protesters and arrests of its organizers.

Just to square up my positionality, I should also note that my partner is a nurse working back-to-back 12 hour shifts endlessly in a private Retirement/LTC complex and I have witnessed through her eyes the ravages of this pandemic.  I find anti-mask and COVID-denial rhetoric not just distasteful and unhelpful, but deplorable as it has directly lead to the unnecessary deaths and suffering of so many vulnerable people.",gjnp7kq,t3_kyvlyd,1610923096,1610948296.0,/r/ontario/comments/kyvlyd/toronto_police_arrest_protestor_at_dundas_square/gjnp7kq/,2021-01-17 22:38:16,2021-01

The problem is schools were shut down a week before Christmas, so schools were closed for two weeks and yet the numbers in early January kept rising.

Schools may well have been a key driver but the studies I’ve read don’t support that. It’s easier to get 5 year-olds to follow protocols than adults apparently. Due to massive online learning numbers, kids were social distanced in a way that many factories aren’t. And the overwhelming death totals are from LTC, not a surprise.

2643,IPokePeople,ontario,"So once again, support that arguement.

Ford has proposed to amalgamate both ambulance services (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-ambulance-paramedic-merger-emergency-health-1.5099773) and health units (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-public-health-1.5435445), not cut them.  Again, framing things as 'cuts' when they are in fact not is a disingenuous argument.  They committed to zero front-line staff reductions, talking about merging departments such as payroll and management.  I don't care about reducing 3 CEO's making 300k+ down to one if all the nurses are keeping their jobs. 

""The investment in health care is not in line with population growth.""  Here we agree.  The 2018-2019 budget to the 2019-2020 budget increase was only 2.8% (1.7 billion dollars).  Historically, from 2011-2017 increases averaged a 2.2%.  So again, it is true to say that the Ford government increased health spending higher than any former government did for the last decade outside of election years.

So what can we do?  Cut administration while increasing front line money.  That's literally the point behind the amalgamations you discussed as cuts. Amalgamating CCAC's and the LHINs was a nice start, but personally I have no idea why the LHINS have a sunshine list that reads like a who's who of former EDs and CEOs from other health agencies pushing past retirement age.  Get rid of the LHINs and bring back the local Ministry Health Councils so the government has to actually answer directly to the people instead of an extra line of bureaucracy.   

Ontario has the largest sub-sovereign debt in the world.  Interest payments are our 4th largest line item.

Stop trying to view Ford as evil, and try to view the good and bad in his approach. Yes there are imperfections, no denying that. My view is that all things considered, I understand why he's acting the way he did. It's reasonable and is his own version of balanced. There are places where I agree with him, and places where I disagree. 

If when you look at a politician, everything you see is negative: the problem is likely you. Be critical. 

&gt;He has a set of experts that he hand picked, and even those people he doesn't listen to. There were leaked documents that show his experts gave recommendations for the lockdown leveling system, like it should move to red at 40 cases per 100k but instead ford changed it so they only move to red at 100 cases.

&gt;He also ignored the advice from sick kids for how to reopen schools safely. They said their number one advice was lower class sizes, which he didn't do. 

Agreed for both of these. The color system was stupid. The class sizes should be smaller. I agree with you here.

Honestly, I don't believe he's trying to make it into a game. There's no way his communications team is telling him to call people buffoons and stuff. This is his personality. It doesn't come across well, but he's not making it a game. He's saying this stuff is scary, and it is. 

&gt; It was one small store that targets wealthy torontonians.

Did you walk around convenience stores or look at Amazon at that time. A simple thermometer would cost people $90. It wasn't one store- that was just the one that turned into memes. 

It's not a problem any more, so he stopped talking about it.

&gt;We tax progressively, the more you make the more you pay

This is how we tax people, not companies. Other than small business exemptions which don't apply to this convo. We tax companies through sales tax and corporate taxes. Both of these increase as a company performs better. 

Changing sales tax raises costs to everyone. This would hurt too many people right now. And even though we could adjust corporate tax rates, it would do very very little right now.

&gt;How are we going to pay for all the debt we're accumulating

Seriously, this is so misguided. The government should be spending all their effort on vaccinating people and slowing the spread. It's not about collecting more revenue right now. No party in Ontario would be doing that. Changing tax code is a ton of work - this is a problem for after the pandemic. Besides, yes this a lot of debt, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to our total provincial debt. 

&gt;Of course it affects the math. The viral reproduction numbers give you the shape of the curve. The number of cases per capita tell you where you are on the curve. Let's do a simple example: let's say you have a virus that results in 2 new infected people every day for every 1 case. If today you have 5 cases, then tomorrow you will have 10 new cases, the next day 20 new cases, etc... But if today you have 10,000 cases, then tomorrow you have 20,000 new cases and the next day 40,000 cases. Do you see the difference? With the first, you have a lot more time to act before your hospitals get overwhelmed.

This is exactly what I was saying. If the coefficient is greater than 1, the number of cases grows. If it's less than 1, it's shrinks. 

Last time we put these measures in place, it brought the coefficient below 1 and cases started coming down. With the measures now, cases are shooting up. 

&gt;It's like if you buy stocks on margin, and the stocks go down, you may have to sell some of the stocks to pay the margin loan. No one complains about that. In fact, risk is the justification usually given as to why an investor deserves their profit.

Yes, but these are homes, not stocks. If you create an environment where people are forced to foreclose or sell, it will have second and third order effects that are immeasurable. 

Agreed that the landlord's signed up for these risks independently, but when you force people to sell or foreclose an asset that is levered 3-5x, you are going to create massive economic shocks that will disrupt the entire province. 

And besides, the Ford government is the one who put the ban in the first place. That is such an anticonservative move normally. He announced yesterday the ban is coming back. 

&gt;Paid sick days are a huge issue. Probably the number one thing that would move the needle right now in terms of keeping spread down.

Agreed that it's a huge issue. I don't necessarily believe it's the number one thing, but I agree that it's big. 

&gt;why is it you are up to date on people gathering but not on lack of paid sick days? It's because of what ford is choosing to focus on.

Because it became a conversation yesterday and I hadn't gotten to learning about it? Every single point you brought up was something that became news - it's the same thing. I just didn't read the latest news on the topic. I've been informed on pretty much every counter point you've brought up...


&gt;And he's making that choice not because it's in the best interest of the people but because it's in his best interest.

Come on. That's such a cynical view. You can be better than this. 

&gt;But because schools were so unsafe, a lot of teachers took early retirement. You can't really blame people who are at higher risk due to age for not wanting to work in an unsafe environment. So they are backfilling some of those positions, not adding new ones. At least I haven't seen anything to suggest they are increasing the number of teachers at all

Agreed. You are probably right, but they appear to be struggling to fill these roles as it is. I do think smaller class sizes would be ideal. 

&gt;Why did ""it take a bit""?

Because this shit is hard. He got to the targets he set. It was just a bit delayed. Getting to 50k daily tests was an ambitious goal, and they accomplished it. 

Give credit where it's due. 

&gt;Ford specifically declined to increase testing capacity during the summer. They had the staff and the space but needed more machines and he said no, that he didn't feel it was worth the cost. How many fewer cases would we have today if he had bought the machines then, like all the experts were telling him to?

Source please? Everything I've looked at has suggested that they were taking a specific approach to acquiring this equipment. They got to their goal and then some. Why would he decline once and approve it the next. 

&gt;My point is it's not just about the number of tests per capita, but rather if we have the right number for our current situation, for which we clearly have too few. Do you get what I mean?

Agreed that more testing would be helpful. That being said, between pharmacies and dedicated testing locations, anyone is allowed to get tested now. The government has been blitzing certain groups as well. If the testing backlog isn't going up, then more capacity will only be useful if people go get tested. Given that our tests have consistently been below our max capacity, it doesn't seem that capacity is the problem. We need to test more groups and encourage more testing.

In terms of community and culture, it is probably one of the best places to move to in NS. The region is beautiful and full of life, and a huge chunk of the people who live there are also originally from away. There's an impressive Farmer's market, and a regularly active private theatre that hosts both films and live shows. As a community I'd say its one of the best. 

Of course its hardly paradise. Its still a rural area, and the nearest cities are 40-60 minutes drives away. The internet is pretty terrible, however they are planning to install fibre op soon; not sure if it'll reach Graville Ferry though. The housing market used to be very cheap, but has started to go up in recent years and will likely only increase. There's not much available for young people to do as it is a mostly retirement community, but it is a safe and comfortable area. Overall I definitely recommend Granville and Annapolis Royal, but as soon as you start heading out towards the other towns you start to find a lot of empty and dying towns filled with problems. Bridgetown had to merge with Annapolis because of this, and though there is hope for the future as internet improves and more young people move in, some of the other small towns are currently not great places to live.

2691,QueueOfPancakes,ontario,"&gt;the health experts have made recommendations

He has a set of experts that he hand picked, and even those people he doesn't listen to. There were leaked documents that show his experts gave recommendations for the lockdown leveling system, like it should move to red at 40 cases per 100k but instead ford changed it so they only move to red at 100 cases.

He also ignored the advice from sick kids for how to reopen schools safely. They said their number one advice was lower class sizes, which he didn't do. 

&gt;He's trying to get people to take this shit seriously, and people are tired of COVID restrictions. 

It seems like making it into some kind of game implies that it's not serious, not that it is.

&gt;Did you not see the bottles of wipes that costed 10 times their normal price? These are essential items that people needed to be safe. This was a rampant problem in early COVID

It wasn't a rampant problem. It was one small store that targets wealthy torontonians. The vast majority of people  shop at big chains like Loblaws. If he wants it to be illegal, fine whatever, but it's not limited to that, the devoted multiple press conferences to it. That is his playbook. He takes a small thing that doesn't make a material difference and he distracts people with it. Instead of people asking ""where is the ppe our health workers need?"" He's like ""oh, look, expensive wipes! This cannot stand. It will get my full attention!""

Currently he's doing the same thing but it's using people having get togethers as a distraction from spread in ""essential"" workplaces. Is people gathering a problem? Yes. Is it the most pressing problem currently, the one that warrants 90% of the press conference each time? No, absolutely not. But it's better for ford if everyone feels it's other regular people to blame, and not him, the premier.

&gt;Taxing them how exactly? Tax code is something that takes time to change.

So he should start changing it.

&gt;And besides, should the government really be taxing companies more because they happen to be in an industry that's winning here?

We tax progressively, the more you make the more you pay. I don't mean we should only tax them during the pandemic, I mean they should pay their share always. That means that whoever is doing very well pays a bit more, but it's no problem, because they are doing so well. It's like if you got a huge raise right now. We wouldn't say ""all that money is tax free!"" We would expect you pay a small part of it in taxes. Isn't that fair?

&gt;When these companies do better, the government makes more tax revenues anyways

Not currently, that's my point. We have loopholes that allow them to pay little to no tax, no matter how well they do.

&gt;The government isn't focused on making more tax revenue right now, nor should they be. 

Of course they should be. How are we going to pay for all the debt we're accumulating? We had debt before as well. I'm not saying it's not ok to run a deficit during a pandemic, of course we will, but we need to be thinking about how we will pay for it over the long term. As you said, tax changes take time. We can't afford to wait years before even starting.

&gt;This sounds anticorporate, rather than something that actually helps anyone. Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding something. 

Hopefully I've clarified for you. I have no problem with big corporations as long as they are good community members. A major component of that is paying their fair share of taxes.

&gt;buck a beer

No, I just meant that even before the pandemic he could have been working on things to help Ontarians but instead wasted time of stupid things like that. Since the claim was that he really cares about us I thought you meant even before the pandemic.

&gt;I just described an example of there being more to the story? They timed the eviction ban perfectly to the federal plan for mortgage deferrals. That sounds extraordinarily well thought out, not reckless. 

No, I reworded what you described to show that it really isn't ""more"" to the story. The story is that wealthy people don't want to have to sacrifice part of the large profit they are making on their investment, even if it means kicking people out onto the street during a pandemic, and that Ford agrees with them that that's ok. That ford has the power, very easily, to stop them, but he isn't.

Investment properties didn't even qualify for federal mortgage deferrals in the first place, rightfully. Many banks decided to offer them as their own internal business decision, and some banks are still granting deferrals. It depends on the customer's credit.

But you seem to be missing the key element here that these properties are investments. It's like if you buy stocks on margin, and the stocks go down, you may have to sell some of the stocks to pay the margin loan. No one complains about that. In fact, risk is the justification usually given as to why an investor deserves their profit.

&gt;Take a look at the death counts. We were almost definitely undercounting before. We are probably still undercounting. We have fewer deaths per day right now than we did at the height of the march wave

Yes, thankfully we (in this case I mean the global medical community) have gotten better at covid treatment so far fewer cases end up resulting in death now. But that's not because of anything ford did. And if we overflow icu capacity, which we are very close to doing, deaths will very quickly climb.

&gt;Either way, this wouldn't effect the math. Vaccines are viral. The restrictions we place reduce the viral coefficient. If the viral coefficient is less than 1, cases drop. If not, they grow. Something is different between how the restrictions are impacting how viral this virus is

Of course it affects the math. The viral reproduction numbers give you the shape of the curve. The number of cases per capita tell you where you are on the curve. Let's do a simple example: let's say you have a virus that results in 2 new infected people every day for every 1 case. If today you have 5 cases, then tomorrow you will have 10 new cases, the next day 20 new cases, etc... But if today you have 10,000 cases, then tomorrow you have 20,000 new cases and the next day 40,000 cases. Do you see the difference? With the first, you have a lot more time to act before your hospitals get overwhelmed.

&gt;My suspicions are that the virus naturally spreads less in summer, similar to the flu. That's just an educated guess though. 

Yes, they already know this to be true. The virus survives longer in the cold (see outbreaks at meat packing facilities) and people are outdoors much more in the warm weather (better airflow reduces chance of infection). They've know this to be true since the summer. We can track it across the winter seasons in both hemispheres.

&gt;Agreed. I'm not fully up to date on today's news though, so can't speak much to it.

Paid sick days are a huge issue. Probably the number one thing that would move the needle right now in terms of keeping spread down. This goes back to what I was saying before, why is it you are up to date on people gathering but not on lack of paid sick days? It's because of what ford is choosing to focus on. And he's making that choice not because it's in the best interest of the people but because it's in his best interest.

&gt;I don't have data to back this up - but my mom's a teacher. Apparently Ontario is hiring a lot of teachers right now. The Ford government seems to agree with you too. 

They don't. Ford refused to provide funding to lower class sizes. But because schools were so unsafe, a lot of teachers took early retirement. You can't really blame people who are at higher risk due to age for not wanting to work in an unsafe environment. So they are backfilling some of those positions, not adding new ones. At least I haven't seen anything to suggest they are increasing the number of teachers at all.

&gt;It took a bit, but the government did. They've done 8 mill tests so far. Per capita, we have done more tests than any other province.

Why did ""it take a bit""? Ford specifically declined to increase testing capacity during the summer. They had the staff and the space but needed more machines and he said no, that he didn't feel it was worth the cost. How many fewer cases would we have today if he had bought the machines then, like all the experts were telling him to?

And even now, yes we have the most of the provinces but we also have much worse case counts. PEI has almost the same number of tests per capita, but they have very low case counts per capita and a much much lower positivity rate. A high positivity rate means that one is likely under testing and missing cases, which of course means people don't know they are sick and then spread it and infect others.

BC has far fewer tests per capita, but also has a lower positivity rate and half the case counts per capita, just as another example. My point is it's not just about the number of tests per capita, but rather if we have the right number for our current situation, for which we clearly have too few. Do you get what I mean? We need to increase our testing significantly, still. Again, if we had acted sooner to increase it, maybe we wouldn't need so much now, but we do need more now.

My biggest frustration is there isn't a party nor a candidate that aligns with my views. I'm a believer in taking care of people, making sure people have education, healthcare, even basics like paid sick days. Equally so I'm a big believer in government being responsible with money, and I have not seen that happen in my relatively short life time (I'm a millennial). 

With the Ford government we have sick days clawed back to help businesses, and we have cuts in things like education and healthcare so we can spend on stupid things like new license plates, and dropping the floor price of beer.

I have to enter the drivers room. I grab my paper work and leave. But most drivers stand around chit chatting. Sometimes 10 at a time in a room similar to a 35ft long hallway. Some without masks. 

I then get into a truck that was driven by someone else the day before. I drive around to retirement homes to deliver food to their kitchens. Some I go inside of others I do not. 

I do not have access to a washroom all day and can only use the hand sanitizer provided to me. Which basically turns to mud when it hits my hands as they become dirty throughout the day. 

When I asked if all of the deliveries would be returning to outdoor deliveries due to the second lockdown I was basically laughed at. 

If I am delivering inside a Retirement home or LTC, they are required to have all doors open and no staff near me. Regularly staff are near me and kitchen staff make a huge fuss over having to open doors for me. 

I do not feel safe at work.

You said: ""The result of this means that people that depend on this as their income **(retirees mainly)** will lose their shirts and their carefully planned retirement goes to shit.""

Most people who own investment properties or a basement apartment aren't going to see their retirements go up in smoke because they didn't get rent for a few months.

I am not saying that a tenant never has to pay their rent or that it is totally fair to the landlord. But the social cost of evicting thousands of people in the middle of a pandemic far outweighs the temporary impact on landlords (most of whom have seen their property values skyrocket over the past year). There is no perfect solution to this, unfortunately.

Plus, the same economic conditions that are going to lead landlords to want to push for large scale evictions also mean they are going to be unlikely to find a desirable replacement tenant during that time.",gi30gcm,t3_kqafr4,1609779632,1609804832.0,/r/ontario/comments/kqafr4/do_most_people_on_this_sub_work_from_home/gi30gcm/,2021-01-04 17:00:32,2021-01
2774,duck1014,ontario,"Question for you with regards to eviction.  I'd like to hear an honest answer.  (this is not my situation, but one that exists for real).

A home owner has a basement apartment.  They rely on the rent from that apartment to assist with paying their mortgage.  Their tenant refuses to pay their rent siting 'but COVID'.  Now, that home owner will be in severe financial distress, because, without that rent payment (after a couple months) will no longer be able to pay the mortgage.   

This is a very real situation.  Basement apartments are everywhere.  

Now then, you could suspend mortgage payments.  The question here is how long can the major banks go without receiving this money?  3 months?  6 months?

2776,EveMB,alberta,"My last day of work was May 8, 2020. I had plane tickets booked for May 9 to visit my sister in Winnipeg to have some beers together and celebrate. And hang out for a few days to plan my next moves.

But in mid-March we were sent home from work. i thought it was fairly short term at the time. But as the days and weeks wore on, things started to happen. Things got real on April 20th when WestJet moved my flight a day forward (which was impossible for me). On April 21st they flat out cancelled my return flight. I still tried to make it work but it soon became clear that if I made it to Winnipeg I might wind up stranded for weeks (my imagination didn’t go to months at the time) at my sister’s place. I love my sister and her husband, but at the end of a week or two I’m wanting to go home.

I sadly gave that up with the idea that we were all going to be with my brother for his November birthday and retirement. Well I think we all knew how far that went.

So I haven’t been able to hang out with my family. We’ve stayed in touch via iMessage and occasional Facetime which is nice but not like sitting and hanging out.

But the big thing I’ve given up is a proper retirement. Don’t get me wrong. A life without alarm clocks and silly work stress has been wonderful. But my vision for retirement was much more than that. I was looking forward to taking advantage of cheaper travel when I didn’t have to balance fares against vacation days. I was looking forward to being able to hang out in coffee shops and in libraries. I wanted to do some of the touristy things in Edmonton like visit galleries and museums during office hours. I wanted to attend public lectures at the University which mostly happened during the afternoon. I wanted to take long walks knowing I could take breaks at intervals for toilets and refreshments. 

Instead, I’ve been mostly in my apartment since March with occasional self-granted breaks to go buy food and walk around the block when the sidewalks are relatively ice free.

And I’m one of the privileged ones with a comfortable apartment and enough money that I don’t have to worry. I have control over my life so that I can take precautions unlike those poor folks in the long term care facilities.

On the bright side, I’ve got May 8th 2021 slated as a second “freedom day”. With the vaccinations ramping up (not fast enough but I’m still optimistic), I’ll at least have a sense of progress by then. I might even have my vaccination so that I can move around to those places that might be open to me by then.

Appointment of Mike Harris to Order of Ontario sparks anger
BETSY POWELL JANUARY 01, 2021
Former premier Mike Harris’s appointment to the Order of Ontario — the province’s highest honour — is sparking outrage online amid the COVID-19 debacle in long-term-care homes and his current position as board chair of one of the largest operators.

Suze Morrison, Ontario NDP MPP for Toronto Centre, tweeted Harris “is the last person” she would put on a list of Order of Ontario appointees announced New Year’s Day.

Harris, ex-leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, was premier from 1995 to 2002.

“He laid the groundwork for privatizing long-term care. At the helm of Chartwell this year oversaw record profits — literally profiteering off a pandemic while our elders died,” she tweeted.

Harris has been chair of Chartwell Retirement Residences since 2003.

In an interview, Morrison said the timing couldn’t be worse.

“In a moment in time when we’ve lost thousands of seniors to COVID-19 in these poorly managed, privatized homes, for the sake of profits, to recognize Mike Harris with this highest honour . . . is devastating to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in long-term care this year.”

A government spokeswoman acknowledged receiving the Star’s request for comment about the Harris backlash, but did not respond further.

Ottawa law student Tom Naciuk called the appointment “cronyism.”

“Appointing the chair of Chartwell, Mike Harris, to the Order of Ontario, particularly after everything that has happened with for-profit LTC homes, is a sickening example of cronyism,” Naciuk wrote on Twitter.

Chartwell did not respond to a request for comment about the Harris backlash.

But in a scathing June 2020 email sent to the CBC in response to what it called “a highly subjective portrayal of the COVID-19 situation in Canadian long-term care,” the CEO of Chartwell, Vlad Volodarski, defended Harris’s record as chair — and premier.

The email said the LTC sector “has been vocal for some time now with all levels of government . . . that it was facing staffing issues well before COVID-19,” Volodarski wrote in the email.

He also challenged the CBC to “substantiate the claim that a drop in care levels dates back to when Mike Harris was premier.”

While the Harris government moved from mandatory minimum staffing levels to a different funding formula, “within this funding system the average number of care hours has increased.”

Volodarski’s email also stated that during Harris’s tenure as premier, “the capacity of the Ontario LTC sector was expanded by 20,000 new beds and 16,000 old beds have been renovated . . . ,” he wrote, adding “There have been no meaningful investments in capacity expansion or renovation programs in the Ontario LTC sector ever since.”

Chartwell has approximately 200 long-term-care homes in its portfolio, of which only 23 are LTC in Ontario, the email stated.

The Star has reported that during the first three-quarters of 2020, Extendicare, Sienna Senior Living and Chartwell Retirement Residences saw disproportionately more deaths among residents than the average in Ontario non-profit or municipally run long-term-care homes. In that same time period, the three operators made huge payouts to investors while taking millions in government funds, a Star analysis of data shows.

Lt-Gov. Elizabeth Dowdeswell, chancellor of the Order of Canada, announced 47 appointees for 2019 and 2020 on Friday.

“We have seen the best of Ontarians this year, and many of these new appointees are being honoured for a lifetime of service to this province, laying the groundwork of resilience and community that each one of us was called to act upon in this historic global pandemic,” Dowdeswell said in a news release.

“Let these appointees inspire you and encourage you to honour those around you by nominating them to be recognized by the province. We have much to be proud of.”

The release did not say why the two years were lumped together and government spokespersons did not provide an explanation by deadline.

The 2019 appointees to the Order of Ontario are:

Melanie Adrian, Roland “Roly” Armitage, Allan Carswell, Helen Ching-Kircher, John Colangeli, Nancy Coldham, Sean Conway, Clare Copeland, Barbara Croall, Lisa Farano, Geoff Fernie, Allan Fox, John Freund, Susan Hay, John Jennings, Marlys Koschinsky, James W. Leech, Audrey Loeb, Dani Reiss, Janis Rotman, Linda Silver Dranoff and Joan Sutton Straus.

The 2020 appointees to the Order of Ontario are:

2805,sseeeds,alberta,"I did some googling in response to your comment.

There was an MLA pension from 1969-1989, and nothing since then.

There was a supplemental RRSP contribution between 2001 and 2012, and nothing since then.

There is this, however:

&gt; Since 2012, Members of the Legislative Assembly who have served a minimum of 3 months in that fiscal year shall receive a retirement investment amount equal to 13 per cent of the Member’s indemnity allowance.  In addition, a Member who has served a minimum of 3 months in that fiscal year may make a contribution to the Member’s RRSP account up to 3.65 per cent of their indemnity allowance, and the Legislative Assembly Office shall contribute an amount to the member’s RRSP account that is equal to the contributions made by the Member.

So that sounds like basically they get a fixed amount of RRSP contribution, plus additional RRSP matching, which is pretty significant.  I had been under the impression that ""no pension"" really meant nothing, but this is more than I thought.

Going back to the original comment, though, it only takes 3 months of service per fiscal year to qualify.",ghnfyau,t3_knyfnn,1609455260,1609480460.0,/r/alberta/comments/knyfnn/facebook_photos_show_ucp_mla_pat_rehn_spent/ghnfyau/,2020-12-31 22:54:20,2020-12

The management at the individual homes are just nurses with more administrative duties and don’t have control over the budget.  Her management team has been working shifts in the floor this whole pandemic and haven’t taken a single day off.  Their days off are time at home to do paperwork while they are still on-call answering the phone in the middle of the night and driving in at all hours any serious incident.  My partner started off at an agency and worked at dozens of places across Hamilton, Burlington and Oakville.  This is one of the best places she’s worked at.

She has told me horror stories about serious negligence at high end care homes in England where she worked for 7 years, even at one of the good ones where she clinical lead (charge nurse) for a dementia ward where management would falsify documentation before inspections and hide evidence of problems from the government and the families of the residents it was taking care of.

Ultimately the buck stops with the government who is responsible for protecting its citizens both by providing bodies in a state of emergency and by upholding standards of care for LTC and retirement.

2811,ROVpilot101,ontario,"I agree.  I’m not blaming the military for not just stepping in.  I’m blaming whoever is in charge of making that happen.  I recognize that falls on provincial officials at the moment.

Further to that, I agree that in some circumstances, private companies should remunerate the military service members for their work.  The counter argument is that we are already paying tax dollars for our military, and LTC is technically government funded, so however the government agencies want to work it out, it doesn’t matter, Canadian citizens need help right now.

I can’t speak to all private LTCs as I only have exposure to one company that my partner works for as a nurse.  They have a number of facilities across Ontario that have both retirement and LTC.  This complicates things as retirement is entirely private.  The home my partner works at has had an ongoing outbreak because family members who are registered as caregivers continue to infect family members.  And it lingered on for over a month because of several false positives and several residents who were in hospital.  Frustratingly the outbreak couldn’t be declared over even though there were no cases in the building.  Retirement is now out of outbreak but LTC has just begun.  It’s important to note that many of these retirement homes house people who can’t afford private care and are on a waiting list for LTC.  Their family members become the caregivers and as a result there is a constant revolving door of non-medically trained people coming and going.  The staff and the management communicate protocols very clearly in writing and in person as well as running testing clinics weekly, but the majority of infections have been traced to family members.  There are other frustrating incidents where people sneak into the building or have even snuck residents out for family gatherings.  The internal transmissions have been tragic mistakes by residents or infections in hospital.  For example, two otherwise diligent residents sharing a magazine by pushing it under their neighbours door sprees ding Covid from one to the other.

In some circumstances there are homes that have had massive outbreaks with widespread transmission internally.  This could be due to staff members neglecting their proper protocols, residents refusing to wear masks (my partner had to deal with two residents who were Covid deniers and ended up testing positive) and some very bad luck with asymptomatic spreaders.  There are many potential factors and Each will need to be investigated thoroughly with those in charge held to account.  When these large outbreaks occur, like the facility in Windsor, where dozens and dozens of staff members test positive, the larger companies will try to shuffle as many staff to that facility as possible, but they can’t directly neglect residents at their other facilities.  My girlfriend would move to Windsor to help but she would leave her own facility hamstrung.  The home in Windsor needs bodies to deliver meals, to work at the screening desk, to aid in sitting/standing/showering/eating etc.  On a lock down, no resident leaves their room and every suspected case requires full isolation procedures gowning up with fresh PPE before entering every room.  These residents also need vitals checks (especially pulse ox) every two hours.  This is incredibly time consuming and stretches homes to the limit with a full staff.  As soon as they are down staff members, it becomes impossible to actually meet the needs of the residents or to follow protocol correctly.  When I heard of this outbreak there were 60 staff members who rested positive, meaning they all have to stay home for two weeks.  That is an unimaginable blow to the workforce.  This home needs help now.


As for staffing issues.  Again I can only speak to the one private company I have had exposure to.  The problem isn’t that they are unwilling to hire more staff, it’s that there are not enough people available to hire.  They rely heavily on agencies when they are short of staff, and even then agencies are unable to meet their needs.  Unfortunately, many staff members quit when the first wave hit hard and again when the outbreak began at their facility.  Part of this was due to child care needs during school closures, part of this were people afraid of becoming infected, some of which are staff who are at higher risk.  There were issues with nursing staff as well as PSWs.  The facility my partner works at constantly advertises for new staff, and there are very few applicants.  To their credit, the company has offered to put up any and all staff members in a hotel during the outbreak to make sure they aren’t bringing Covid home to their families if they are exposed.

The obvious counter-argument is that the staff are not compensated enough to keep working.  My partner has been a geriatric RN for a decade but as an immigrant she worked as a PSW for over a year trying to get the OCN to recognize her licence.  As a PSW she was paid minimum
wage.  Even with the bonus that the government gave front line workers (which they don’t receive anymore despite the pandemic being worse than ever) she would have earned more taking CERB than staying at her job.  She, like many others, selflessly went to work every day under increasingly difficult conditions.  This is unacceptable to me.  This level of remuneration is longstanding practice for the entire PSW workforce, and that needs to change.  I blame the private companies for this, but I also blame the government for not mandating wages be higher, especially in LTC where the residents have no power to advocate for themselves and the government is ultimately accountable for the well being of the residents.  I see my partner and her colleagues as heroes.  I couldn’t do what they do for those wages.  I also couldn’t pay my current rent at those wages (I had to take the brunt of the bills while she was a PSW).  I don’t know how these (predominantly immigrant women) raise their families on that level of income or the long hours that they work.  They are truly remarkable and selfless members of our community.  I can’t blame the sizeable number of staff for leaving during the pandemic to protect their families or to earn more from CERB or to go back to school in September.  This needs to change immediately.  The local management at a single facility can’t affect this.  They have a limited budget and don’t have the power to increase all PSW wages.

Now, my partner has had her nursing licence recognized, and her remuneration is much more livable.  She still works for the same company at the same facility, but is currently on the retirement side despite her specialization in dementia.  Protocols mandate that staff from retirement and LTC don’t mix.  Compartmentalizations is key to mitigating risk of infections.  Keeping a full nursing staff has been a nightmare and staff can’t share shifts between compartments.  They actually set staffing standards to have more than usual to accommodate these divisions and extra nursing shifts during the outbreak to manage all the tasks required.  Unfortunately, people leave, very few respond to job postings and new hires quit before starting.  One week went by where four separate nurses were interviewed and then declined the offer.  They have filled in missing shifts with agency staff when absolutely necessary (although they don’t like the risk of infection) and by current staff pulling a lot of overtime.  Apparently management tried to offer wage incentives to attract and retain new nurses but union politics and the collective agreement with the head office would have delayed the process by months, if it would happen at all and the idea was dropped.

Higher wages for front line workers is an obvious  (partial) solution to these problems.  More staff will be retained, the stress and the risks will be more worthwhile and corners are less likely to be cut.  Higher staff numbers need to be mandated for these facilities especially during outbreaks, but people need to be incentivized to take the jobs.  Training programs need to be expanded.  The government has the responsibility to set a high standard of care and to hold private companies to account.  These are the same facilities we will all be living in eventually.

In the short term, medical staff at homes with significant outbreaks cannot physically perform all the tasks needed to keep their residents safe and well cared for.  If there is a repository of medically trained individuals in the military paid for by the taxpayer, they should be put to use helping our citizens.  This is an emergency.  We need them.",ghlwg5g,t3_knjcti,1609425143,1609450343.0,/r/ontario/comments/knjcti/province_needs_to_call_in_the_military_again_to/ghlwg5g/,2020-12-31 14:32:23,2020-12

Id like to pose the question - is immigration a permanent solution or should we be at the very least trying to address the issue with our birth rates?

Maybe at the very least we should then admit to ourselves that the standard of living that Canada had in the 60s-2010 is no longer attainable for this upcoming generation.

2841,aardvarkious,alberta,"Albertans contribute more because they are younger on average. Compared to other provinces, we have a much lower retiree:worker ratio.

THEORETICALLY, we could create an Alberta Pension Plan that leverages our current young work force and plans for an aged population in the future. We could either pay what we are paying now and have better benefits when we retire, or pay less than we pay now for the same retirement benefits. Theoretically.

However, I have zero faith in a populist government that acts in as bad faith as the UCP. They are thinking about what is popular now, not about our future. I've got zero confidence that they would appropriately plan for an aging population. Instead, I strongly believe they would give low contributions now at the risk of shortchanging us in the future if our retiree:worker ratio increases.

I also have zero faith that they would work collaboratively enough with the feds to make an APP transferable. I'm worried it would severely hamper labour mobility into and out of Alberta.

I'm also very confident that they would leverage the APP to prop up Alberta industry. Which is the exact opposite of what I want. I don't want this money invested in Alberta. I want it invested elsewhere as a hedge if our provincial revenues (and therefore the non-APP social safety nets) continue to be low.

I'm open to the idea of an APP if it is consrrvatively planned for an aging demographic, fully transferable if I leave the province, and diversified outside of AB. I'm completely and adamantly opposed to it otherwise.

That means I am completely opposed to it under UCP leadership.",ghby3xh,t3_klwqab,1609194248,1609219448.0,/r/alberta/comments/klwqab/ucp_attempting_to_take_the_cpp_and_make_it/ghby3xh/,2020-12-28 22:24:08,2020-12
2842,Gruff403,alberta,"What worries me is that so many don't understand how CPP works and that the UCP spread just enough truth mixed in with lies that may convince enough Albertans to go for this. One example is the frequent belief that CPP contributions go to the Federal Gov't - they don't.  They go to the CPPIB which, although a Crown Corp, is one of only five Crown Corp protected by law from Government interference.  CPPIB is one of the top ten best managed pension funds in the world. 

 Take the statement: ""Albertans contributed $2.9 billion more to the CPP than they consumed in 2017.""   This is one the UCP loves to throw around and comes from a Fraser Institute report.  The statement is true however the application in the Premiers argument is false. Current CPP payments fund current recipients all across Canada and the difference is retained by the CPPIB to invest.  Your contributions are tracked to help determine what you will be entitled to when the time comes. It doesn't matter in which Province you worked, Canadians contributions are all the same. The money follows the worker. If I work 10 years in Ontario, 10 years in BC and then 15 years in Alberta the amount I am entitled to is no different then if I worked ALL 35 years in Alberta.  If I then move to Nova Scotia in retirement my entitlement does not change.     But the UCP make it sound somehow unfair that the Alberta worker pays more into CPP fund then current Alberta retirees receive.  It's irrelevant because it doesn't matter if I make $75 000 in Ontario or $150 000 in Alberta, the amount I contribute to CPP is the exact same.

2843,customerservicevoice,ontario,"This is, unfortunately, the correct answer. 


It’s been my tin foil hat theory for awhile that the government simply cannot sustain the elderly anymore. Pensions no longer exist en mass and debt grows so the the cycle of ‘working and contributing to the CPP so you can retire at 65’ plan has been shot all to hell. More and more seniors are entering LTC on the subsidy. Very few are paying the maximum rates anymore and I can’t see millennials being able to afford it, either. We simply don’t make enough. Our employees don’t pay enough. We can barely buy homes. We’re not able to save for retirement the way the government needs us to. CPP is its own little economy and its been in a depression for over a decade. 


I think we’ll start to see subsidies going out to families directly to help seniors stay in family homes and LTC will be reserved for only those that cannot be accommodated elsewhere. I also think Dying With Dignity will be the new LTC admissions.

Care for seniors hasn’t changed because the government doesn’t want it to. They can’t afford it and are working BTS to set up alternatives.

2861,TheBurnerThrowaway,ontario,"Thank you! I've been thinking this too. Look at places like New Zealand and South Korea where both its citizens and government listen to the science and medical experts. Here? It's a bad joke. I've been considering three options to move, none of which I have the money for at the moment, but as soon as I do, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Which is the most sensible to me is to move far up north or far out west in Ontario. In the countryside where cases are low and there's not too much foot traffic. Downside is I'm away from everything and friends, but the upsides are far higher. Cleaner air, affordable housing, less noise pollution, being outdoors more, not feeling angry and miserable like I am in the city and not having to worry as much if there's another pandemic in my lifetime because cases will always be lower than in a city. Plus, I'm a sucker for the countryside scene. I just love clear milky way nights and sunsets. 

Option 2: I move back in Europe. The cases are about double what they are here, but in the whole country. Downside is the move is more risky. The economy sucks there, even without the pandemic and there's no universal healthcare, nor a chance at a good life. My family lives in the countryside there in a small village, so they're relatively safe from Covid, but unless I wanna learn how to be a farmer, there's nothing else for me there. I always wanted to move back home for retirement, but not this early.

Option 3: I look at the countries that managed this pandemic the best over its course and move there. Biggest risk move ever since I don't know anything about them other than bullet points about they function. So I'm thinking South Korea or New Zealand, but open to Japan too. I'd have to learn the language to two of them but have to find a job in my career there, which is hard enough as it is to find here in Canada.",ggt7d66,t3_kikhp3,1608742328,1608767528.0,/r/ontario/comments/kikhp3/ontarios_government_blames_everyone_but_itself/ggt7d66/,2020-12-23 16:52:08,2020-12

I've written many elected officials, both UCP and NDP, and every answer is some variation of the above:

* we value public servants
* Alberta is an fiscally difficult position
* we can't commit to anything, but trust us, the other party will be worse

Your point about non-union being more than just management is a really important distinction.  One difficulty I have is that people in my position keep the same job title from end of their residency until retirement.  The training is too specialized to change careers.

My colleagues in management seem to frequently change job titles - either by moving up, or at least moving laterally, which allows a salary bump that that time.

Another factor is that we all tend to have a B.Sc. from one university, an M.Sc. and Ph.D. from another, and then a residency somewhere else.  So we're all quite mobile, and the idea of moving provinces for a job isn't crazy, and our field is in very high demand.  The number of people we've lost outside of the province is nuts.

To solve this injustice we need more care aids and better care homes.

Other businesses have spent tons of money investing in cleaning supplies, extra custodial staff, safeguards such as plexiglass barriers, etc. If retirement homes are serious about keeping people safe and healthy, they will invest in the PEOPLE who are taking an extra burdens during this difficult time, including a weekly, highly-intrusive test for COVID.",gg1n23k,t3_ke7neb,1608137162,1608162362.0,/r/ontario/comments/ke7neb/retirement_homes_push_ontario_for_mandatory/gg1n23k/,2020-12-16 16:46:02,2020-12

Rate freezes added to it by roughly 900 million. 

Mike Harris’s government set the stage for what was to come by breaking up Hydro One. He also added the debt retirement charge to our bills but kept the rate freeze? So no rates weren’t actually stable, they were hidden under a blanket freeze. This is also the time that door to door electrical rate salespeople began knocking at Ontario’s doors (this is a whole other fiasco perpetrated on hydro users, thanks Harris!)

Much like how Harris himself benefited from how he set the stage for LTC privatization, I can almost bet there is a money trail for hydro if one was to really delve into it. 

Either way, Ontario is sick of his government’s bullshit and swings to what will hopefully be the last of the most corrupt government to lead yet, the Liberals of 2002-2015. Don’t worry Ford still has time here. 

Don’t get me wrong. You are correct in that the Liberals really stunk up hydro, which they couldn’t have accomplished without Harris’ efforts. Along with selling us down the river with those gorgeous green energy contracts for those now defunct windmill assembly plants, the Liberals used our debt retirement charges for things other than the debt it was meant for.

If you are adding anything further, please cite sources as I do want the blame to go where it is deserved. I’m not out here arguing just to argue. My info says this started with Harris’ BS. 

TL/DR: 
Hydro One loaded with debt from nuclear builds. 

Rae, during a major recession freezes rates for a cost shy of $1 billion. 

Harris “restructures” a public entity and sets the stage for privatization, maintains said rate freeze and adds a debt retirement charge to bills.

If you don't want to live on the bare minimum, then take some control over your life and put some money aside.  Even if it's $100/mo it adds up quickly.  And if you can't afford to put $100/mo aside when in the work force then perhaps it time to reassess your priorities in life or find a different job.

3000,metalhawk666,ontario,"All it took was one person.

They came to Niagara from another GTA community for a family visit, not seeing the harm in such a gathering.

Shortly  after this family get-together, according to Niagara’s public health  department, three-quarters of the group contracted the novel  coronavirus. Two of those people are in hospitals on ventilators.

“It  wasn’t a large family gathering, but they did bring some people from  other Ontario communities and one of them, unfortunately, had COVID-19,”  said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara’s acting medical officer of health,  whose department investigated the cases last week. “I think it just  shows why it is important for us right now to really bear down, really  tighten up our social contacts so we can get through this.”

One  of the hospitalized people from that group is on a ventilator at St.  Catharines hospital, where the number of COVID-19 patients has been  rising and Niagara Health leaders fret they are only seeing the tip of  the iceberg.

At the height of the  first pandemic wave in the spring, the single largest number of patients  in the hospital’s COVID-19 unit on a given day was 34, although dozens  at the same time were commonplace until the wave died down.

Twenty new Niagara cases were confirmed Tuesday, and 207 remained active.

There  are now eight patients at St. Catharines hospital, down from 10 on  Saturday — a new second-wave high — in part because one patient died.

Of  166 patients treated at St. Catharines hospital, 45 have died.  Eighty-six Niagara residents with COVID-19 have died since the pandemic  began, 19 of them since Oct. 5.

“I am  concerned about the rising number of cases in the community,” said  Niagara Health president Lynn Guerriero. “As you know, the more people  who become infected, the more likely it is that those who are most  vulnerable will get COVID-19.”

The  post-summer COVID-19 wave continues to be driven by people under the age  of 40, particularly those in their 20s. Hirji has said these infections  are largely happening among groups at restaurants and bars as well as  house parties.

While younger adults  are responsible for most cases each day, the past week has seen a  noticeable rise in cases in people aged 40 to 59. And on Nov. 25, a  person in that middle-aged demographic with COVID-19 died. Hirji has  told the St. Catharines Standard this is often the result of younger  adults infecting older ones.

It  highlights that while most people who have died with the virus are 60  and up, with the majority of deaths being in those over 80, the virus  can be lethal to people of any age.

“There  was also a person under 10 with COVID-19 in Manitoba who died this  weekend,” said Hirji. “If we have more cases you will see more serious  results.”

It  is why the oft-repeated notion from anti-mask groups and even some  politicians that the best strategy is to “protect the vulnerable” while  letting everyone else live their regular lives is a recipe for tragedy,  said Hirji and Guerriero.

Hirji  said that kind of approach would lead to “uncontrolled” spread of  COVID-19, resulting in more serious illness and death. In the second  wave, despite pandemic restrictions and tighter measures at long-term  care homes, the novel coronavirus still reached the more vulnerable with  lethal effects. 

“It’s not practical,” said Guerriero.  “Are you going to lock residents of long-term care and retirement homes  in their rooms? How does that work? You still have staff that you need  to care for those people, and they tend to be younger. We know that is  how the virus got into some homes.”

Hirji  said the family group from last week should serve as a reminder to  everyone that Christmas celebrations should be kept very small this year  and the temptation to include the typical large holiday gathering  should be resisted.

All the virus needs to make someone from a family extraordinarily ill is just one infected person around a dinner table.",geeffhr,t3_k5dqzn,1606934929,1606960129.0,/r/ontario/comments/k5dqzn/two_people_with_covid19_in_hospital_on/geeffhr/,2020-12-02 18:48:49,2020-12

3008,Mojojijo,ontario,"Random989898 has shown you a kindness explaining this matter to you so patiently and kindly. 

Do a bit of math on your solution and it's obvious you're misinformed and over confident.

A single family property is easily north of 500k in many Canadian markets. Tenants earning 1% of that is 5k annually, or about 415$ monthly which is ludicrous.  Enforce that law and either you a) collapse the property rental industry or b) drive up rent by 1% of the property value annually to compensate (aka your rent went from 2k to 2,415$ a month).

I'm guessing you'll be shocked to learn that most rental properties are cash flow negative, meaning the sum of expenses (mortgage, insurance, incidentals, costs to find tenants, etc. ) exceed the rental income earned. People choose this investment as a method to build equity for retirement; not to buy groceries on the day to day. But then factor in capital gain taxes on property investments, which eat a portion of that equity gain. 

On top of all of the above, consider financial risk. Bad tenants can ruin you, bad markets can ruin you, political involvement can ruin you (like recent covid policies). When someone takes a risk in finances, they deserve to be compensated for it. Think of gambling. Who would do it if you never stood a chance of winning something? Gambling without profits is just losing, and that's what your solution to the property rental industry is for land lords: a big fucking loss.

I'll realdily admit I'm anything but an expert on the matter, but these are simple concepts that can be learnt with brief researches. You've clearly done most of your thinking in an online or in person echo chamber.

3009,random989898,ontario,"Home ownership is a lot more expensive than you think. In addition to the mortgage and utilities, you have to pay house insurance,  property tax, and income tax on the rent. You also have to pay for both incidental repairs, upkeep and maintenance and major repairs. Most small landlords are not making much money from tenants. For many without pensions, it is how they will fund their retirement. Removing rental units from the market would increase homelessness as not everyone can afford to purchase a house or pay the costs that come with a house. 

Paying rent is not slavery - you get housing in return for your $$ spent. Paying for housing and other basic costs like food and clothing has been part of most developed economies for a very long time.

A lot of folks from Ontario are retiring to the east coast. It's very common. You use to be able to sell your place in the GTA and move a little further out, pay cash for a house, and still have 300k or 400k in your account.

One but is that, at the moment, it *is* somewhat a choice between looser restrictions on everyday life vs. saving grandma. We know that community spread will effect, and has affected, our LTC homes and hospital capacity. I will be extremely disappointed, saddened, and hurt if something that comes out of the pandemic doesn't end up being a strong, sustained policy &amp; funding commitment for major upgrades and a complete rethinking of our LTC &amp; community-based supports. **However**, that won't help myself, my staff, or my residents and families this year or next. I agree that the system needs to be dismantled and rebuilt in a significantly different way - that doesn't reduce the number of times I'm having to scramble to replace staff who have been exposed at home or in the community, it doesn't lower the chances that I have to spend my evenings making wellness check calls to see if a critically ill colleague is still alive, it doesn't reduce the chances that I spend the next 2-16 weeks of my life spoon-feeding someone who was vibrant days ago and scrounging the city for PPE &amp; disposable dishes at any price because we're burning through a few thousand dollars worth *a day*.

We need some solutions and interventions which can help with those things ASAP. Restrictions to limit community spread are a big one of those.

I actually agree with all the rest for the most part, but there's always going to be a place needed to look after people who's care needs can't be met in the community. I think that place should look radically different from LTC homes today, but it will exist in one form or another. I could tell some horror stories about the state of people we've had admitted to us from the community, a retirement home, or the hospital; even in cases where the family was extremely supportive, well intentioned, and had been able to afford all the private home care services and equipment.

According to OP linked artical he claims that:

"" *​​​​​​Lewis:* It's crazy to allow bars and restaurants and gyms to stay open. They are known worldwide to be three sites where infections take off. Alcohol is a disinhibitor. Loud music makes people lean in and talk louder to be heard over it, expelling more droplets. People exercising strenuously breathe more heavily, sweat, expel. ""

*"" All mass gatherings, including church services, weddings, funerals, should be locked down, and \[there should be\] very strong prohibition of socializing at home with non-family members. ""*

Now lets look at the facts, as they apply here, according to the SHA:

[https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/non-essential-activities-top-shas-list-for-community-transmission-locations](https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/non-essential-activities-top-shas-list-for-community-transmission-locations)

*A news release from the SHA says 25 per cent of infections have happened at recreational facilities like rinks, bingo halls and casinos.*

*Second on the list are social gatherings like weddings, parties and funerals, which represent 17 per cent of community transmission.*

*Third are group homes and shelters, with 14 per cent.*

*Educational institutions, including schools, account for eight per cent of community transmission, as do food services establishments.*

*Long-term care and retirement homes account for seven per cent, while fitness centres and a broad category labelled “transportation and trades” each account for six per cent.*

*Nightclubs account for five per cent of community transmission, followed by places of worship at two per cent.*

It doesn't take long when you compare his opinion to the reality of Sask that he is way off base.

I'ts ""crazy"" to allow bars, restaurants, and gyms to stay open? 5%, 8%, 6% respectively. For us they are on the very low ed of the scale, and do not constitute a huge risk. So shutting them down would cause more harm than the good in reducing cases.

Church services? Well as an atheist I cheer for this, but if I must fall into actual data looks like 2% shouldn't make us use the ol' lords name in vain just yet now should it.

Weddings and funerals are at 17%. Well there is something we should be concerned about. Why didn't he put this higher on his list, did he not know what he was talking about?

Educational insitutions, 8%. Not great but keeping klids in school would be worth the risk at that number.

Rinks, bingo halls, casino's. 25%. But this was not even mentioned by Doc Aussie. Did he simply forget to name the #1 source of transmission? Or maybe he is talking out of his ass.

He should stick to commenting on things he has more recent experience with. When considering how to approach circuit break lock downs and slow downs and avoid ""universal lock downs"" I'll take the advice of all SASK stakeholders.

If I want to know how to perfectly cook shrimp on me Bar-bie I'll ask this clown.

In closing. Ryan Meili, the guy I shit on a lot, has tasked the government to make a joint committee including all stakeholders so everyone can be heard and the best overall decision can be made considering and weighing everything.

So, I 100% agree with Meili. This is a great idea and should be done.

Stop all extra curricular activities. That circuit should be shut down, now. I'm thinking the SP will be announcing this today, how can they not. Supporting your family through economic activity is essential, Timmy will be OK if he can't play hockey. I'm aware that this is economic activity, but the 25% is too high and many people involved are volunteer. The damage justifies the good.

Cops should go to public gathering places and walk patrol. Go through grocery stores and site people for not wearing masks. Our enforcement is a joke.

I have a theory that the government has been scaling back funding for seniors for years because we as a society simply can’t support them. They cost way too much between their CPP, GIS, OAS, subsidies, etc. and they don’t contribute. 


Now, I know what you’re thinking: ‘They worked hard their whole lives and paid into the retirement system.’


Did they, though? Good pensions now are as rare as unicorns and if we’re being honest, seniors are just average people with more wrinkles. Most had average jobs and paid average taxes. Basically, they didn’t contribute all *that* much. They’re just people!


The thing is, the government needs us to make more money and pay more taxes to fund them and we just aren’t. Many millennials invest in TFSA more so than RRSP. The younger generations are finding ways to KEEP their money. We know that we can pay $500/month on a subsidy to be in LTC and a table mate can pay $5k. There are fewer and fewer people able to pay that 5k. Our COL is just too high for the average person. 


Now, I’m not saying millennials don’t have RRSPs or pensions. Some do. A lot don’t. The ‘pay into your retirement GOVERNMENT dream’ is done. We’re learning we can still get the shit care the people paging 5k get.

Someone wealthy enough to own a large family home who has aged out of the maintenance, but doesn't want to take a big lifestyle hit is who buys these things.

The high end of the market here in NB has been invigorated by new money recently after years of stagnation, and I expect the older ppl who sell those higher end places will still need somewhere to live.

I expect that developers will soon start with townhouses and small starter homes to address the market demand of movers from upper canada who could never buy a house up there but can probably go for a small, new, $175,000 bungalow or townhouse. That take a little longer though, but I think it is a good opportunity since most of the starter housing stock around here is aging and less interesting to non-handymen.

&gt; Ban, lock up, punish - the government's corona course was unsuccessful, says medicine professor Matthias Schrappe. The virus can be controlled better through personal responsibility than through surveillance. What would a change of strategy look like in concrete terms?
&gt; The physician and health economist Matthias Schrappe, 65, was Deputy Chairman of the Health Advisory Council from 2007 to 2011. He has been critical of the federal government's corona policy since April. Together with eight other scientists, he is publishing a paper this Sunday in which he calls for a new strategy in the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: Mr. Schrappe, you and eight scientists have written a paper on the federal government and its corona policy. Was that necessary?
&gt; 
&gt; Matthias Schrappe: Yes. Because nothing can be seen that looks like a useful strategy. It starts with the corona tests and certainly does not end with what the government considers to be appropriate for the protection concepts for risk groups. We made it clear in April that there would be foci of infection in hospitals and nursing homes. Specific measures should have been taken immediately. This is still true because almost half of the deaths are from these institutions. But the federal government is resistant to advice. Nevertheless, on Sunday we will publish a thesis paper on how to effectively protect nursing homes and hospitals. We are doing this for the sixth time and we found it difficult to formulate it not always repeating the same thing. It was necessary anyway, because the Germans now have to take the hard road. Particularly endangered people will be left behind. There are no suitable protection concepts for them.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: No protection for the elderly? Tell me the name of the nursing home that still receives unlimited visitors.
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: When people talk about protection in Germany, you can be sure that they mean locking up. I made my clinical career in the beginning of the AIDS years and did my habilitation on HIV infection. At that time homosexual men were approached, addressed as a risk group, and advised. This is how the safer sex campaign came aboutwhich was extremely successful. Nobody would have thought of banning contacts or sex. Against all odds, we took tiny steps to ensure that drug addicts were given Polamidon. That was the name of the then methadone, which is standard today. We received outraged, wild threats. Among other things, psychiatrists rejected the procedure in principle. I am telling this to advertise what has been understood by target group-specific prevention efforts since then. Locking away is certainly not one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: What instead?
&gt; 
&gt; Scrap:Humanity and benevolent protection that emanates from the personality and dignity of those affected. Obviously it's hard to imagine. Why is there no taxi for the price of a public transport ticket for older people in Corona times? Where are the aid programs for people requiring outpatient care? Why can't students who have lost their waiter jobs stand in front of retirement homes for the same money and make cuts? Or shopping services for seniors? Or relieve outpatient care? During this time you have to awaken cohesion, stimulate the imagination, how to protect yourself and others. But that is a management task, for this the federal government would have to be ready to experiment with prevention ideas, it would have to try it out,
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: The Federal Government, but above all the Prime Minister, has a more business term in mind: ""Top Down"". The shepherd whistles, the flock begins to move.
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: I'm a doctor. I like people, I respect the patient's role and autonomy. In the health system, we have recently made great strides in how patients recognize risks and make independent decisions. I hope there will be no turning back to the blindly obedient, docile patient who is not entitled to questions, an opinion or even self-determination.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: What do you advise?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: Germany has left the usual infection control instruments behind. We use them, for example, in the hospital germ MRSA. Even there, nobody knows where the next stove will be, you just know it's coming. Rapid reaction teams help against this, which could also help us with corona protection for vulnerable population groups. An infection that is transmitted asymptomatically cannot be through barrier and follow-up measures alonekept in check. That much was also clear with HIV, also an asymptomatically transmitted disease. There is no other way, there is no alternative but to approach the risk groups. But that has not arrived in politics that only focus on the virus and therefore listen to virologists. This is how disasters arise.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: The current ""Lockdown light"" is supposed to prevent that ...
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: It doesn't matter whether we do this lockdown or not. Nor can it break a wave, as is often claimed. It is more of a long-term increase, as in the other countries.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: Where are we at the end of November?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: The numbers will continue to rise, maybe a little more slowly. Nobody will be able to tell you whether this is due to the lockdown.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: What else should it be?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: A lockdown always and everywhere followed the same course, and that wasn't a success story. There was a steep downward infection curve that cost a lot of sacrifice and suffering. But after the lockdown, the curve quickly regained its old height. Nobody can say today whether a lockdown will also have a longer-term effect.
&gt; 
&gt; There are countries that have had a much harder lockdown than Germany. France, for example, or Spain. They are worse off than we are today. The pandemic is no longer an event that can be slowed down with restrictions. The infections grow in width, this is called the sporadic spread type, which one can only chase after. But there is no way to forestall the virus, which in the long run ruins the health authorities.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: So what to do?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: It would help if the laboratories not only gave the results negative or positive, but also the infectiousness. You know it, it results from the number of cycles, i.e. the duration of the PCR test . The more often the detection reaction has to be repeated, the less virus is present. A child who takes 38 cycles to detect the virus is definitely not infectious. The whole school class doesn't have to be in quarantine. But the health authorities say: That is not in the RKI instructions, we do not take note of it.
&gt; WORLD: What about restaurants, bars and theaters?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: There is no certainty whether we will be infected there. The numbers tend not to speak for it. They can be left open under promising measures. Perhaps not for 500 people in the evening, but for 150. With local public transport, one more wagon could be attached. What you hear is the opposite. Angela Merkel's meeting with the Prime Minister reminds me of my time in the hospital. If the leadership doesn't want you to concern yourself with patient safety, then nothing happens. The government now has a chance to say that we are changing our approach and that there is a different strategy.
&gt; WORLD: Or is she waiting until the vaccine is there?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: The old infectiologist adage applies: The availability of a vaccine is only the first millimeter of a long, long road. Even if you could administer 60,000 vaccine doses per working day, it would take 1000 working days for everyone in Germany to be vaccinated. And it's not just the spades, behind a vaccination campaign is years of effort. Anyone who has a little practical experience knows that you can hardly get there at the age of four. Even an oral vaccination takes years.
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: The Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) says that no other country got through the pandemic with such mild means as well as Germany. Would you agree with that?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: There are six times as many intensive care beds as there are in France, and the intensive care medics say mortality is falling and falling. In this respect, things didn't just go badly in Germany. But before it comes down to closing the schools again, a few thoughts on the subject: ""What we haven't tried yet"".
&gt; 
&gt; WORLD: What do you think of the new Infection Protection Act?
&gt; 
&gt; Schrappe: This increases the state's control power, and medical confidentiality is in danger. We are endangering an important, historically proven basic value of our society.",gcxu5l9,t3_jxezhe,1605879734,1605904934.0,/r/alberta/comments/jxezhe/made_this_dedicated_to_an_old_high_school_pal_who/gcxu5l9/,2020-11-20 13:42:14,2020-11

Now the burden of carrying the retirement class is overwhelming, pension funds own the universe. 

Retirement is a fucking pipe dream for most of us and personally I think the whole concept was dreamt up by the banks to find a way to get us to plough our money into RRSP's which the bank then uses to, oh, I don't know, earn billions while returning us a pittance on interest. 

Then the whole thing gets couched as a complex tax write off, assuming you made enough to plough anything into RRSP's.

Fuck it all, and this is why I fight like hell for UBI. We're at the mercy of a capitalist system that will *eat us fucking alive* while anyone who doing alright has a severe case of 'fuck you got mine'.

I’ve used LTC as an example here but there are plenty of other examples such as meat processing and assembly-line plants where covid spreads readily. BUT, these infections are not equivalent to wide ‘community spread’ and poses little risk to the population if the outbreak is managed. I agree, however, that once there is wide community spread and you are unsure where the virus is being spread, then you need to restrict people’s movements.

Getting viable numbers for community spread are what you need but this is tough without randomized testing and meaningful contact tracing of cases. And even this doesn’t help if you happen to have a statistically unlikely super-spreader event as the symptom-lag may cause an outbreak before it is caught by random testing.

3121,WideGiraffe8675309,saskatchewan,"Just a few things that stood out. The whole article is well done and worth the read though. 

&gt; Saskatchewan has kept its deaths to 31, as of Monday, far fewer than in neighbouring provinces. That stems in part from the province’s relative success in keeping COVID-19 away from long-term care facilities, personal care homes or seniors’ residences, where the elderly face a much higher risk of death. But that record looks increasingly tenuous with 10 such facilities reporting outbreaks in just the past 10 days.

&gt;That includes an outbreak declared Saturday at Revera’s Green Falls Landing retirement residence in Regina, where two staff tested positive. Long-term care homes in Regina, Yorkton, North Battleford, Indian Head and Moose Jaw reported outbreaks in the days previous. Assisted living facilities and personal care homes in Saskatoon and Regina have also seen recent outbreaks. So has a seniors’ residence in North Battleford.

&gt; There are troubling signs that COVID-19 is still spreading exponentially. The effective reproduction number in Saskatchewan is 3.3 as of Nov. 14, meaning each infected person has been passing the virus on to just over three healthy people, on average.

Private sector janitorial staff get on just fine.

3143,Temporary_Mix_5391,ontario,"I'll be using [this](https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/ecupdates/factsheet.html) site to do rough calculations to get a rough estimate for the yearly Ontario expense if UBI was implemented.

So Ontario has a labor force of about 8 million 18 - 65 year olds which is the age range from current legal age of adulthood to the current retirement age at which the government will start providing addition income.

So if every single one of those individuals received $12 000 per year ($1 000 per month) from the Ontario government regardless of any other factor it would cost about (8 000 000 x 12 000 = 96 000 000 000) $ 96 billion dollars per year.

So that is too much and unsustainable, this is where figuring out which factors need to be taken into account in order to strike a balance between those who don't need an additional $12 000 per year and those who do, and these should be thresholds into which a person can get above thus no longer needing the assistance of fall bellow needing the safety net.

The primary income in Ontario and Canada is just shy of $40k, the happiness income range is $60k - $100k with that in mind perhaps the first threshold for the first cut off variable is a yearly income of $90k before UBI (this could be changed to be lower) or above this way you can still hit that $100k but above it you should have enough personal responsibility as not to need that safety net.

So if I read the information on this [site](https://www.fao-on.org/en/Blog/Publications/income-report-2019) somewhat correctly and added in some of my own guesstimating about 25% (I came up with 25% because the information on the site says that about 20% earn more then $103k so I added the 5% to try and increase the number slightly to try and be more representative and also it makes it easier so far for my guesstimating math, but would welcome better data) residents in Ontario earn over $90k. 

With 25% of 8 million no longer qualifying for UBI the new number is about 6 million residents qualifying for UBI, so now with 6 million people being given UBI the expense goes down to (6 000 000 x 12 000 = 72 000 000 000) $72 billion per year. That is still too much, lets either lower the threshold for this factor and/or add another factor to lower the expense.

Before moving on I want to add that UBI is not the answer by it's self it is just one piece of the puzzle in how to simultaneously do multiple things at once in order to allow individuals to have a safe relatively healthy/happy life without turning into a dictator and some countries are further along in figuring this out then Canada, I don't think any country is perfect but a few have certain standards of living which I think are better then in Canada. So if things like healthcare was truly universal within Canada in all aspects the initial costs would be high but long term would end up cheaper since a lot of preventive care will be available meaning $1 dollar spent today could mean $10 saved tomorrow because the treatment is no longer necessary, also the ability to buy supplies in a few bulk orders rather then a thousand different orders would mean the costs would go down.

Where was I, yes using this [site](https://www.policynote.ca/what-is-a-middle-class-income-these-days/) as a guesstimate about 40% of Canadians earn less then $60k per year and about 80% earn less then $40k.

Then if $60k is the new threshold for cut off the to UBI and the % from the site hold about true for Ontario, 40% of 8 Million is 3.2 million.

3.2 million at $12 000 per year drops the expense to $38.4 billion per year

at a $40k threshold  it leaves 1.6 million eligible residents bringing the expense down to about $19.2 billion per year

So if the only factors to qualify for UBI are being between the ages of 18-65 and an income level and it is set to $40k before taxes your math shows that it could be doable if another about $2.2 billion is scrounged up. Which I don't think will be an issue since people having more money in their pocket means they will spend more generating more taxes in all forms thus increasing the budget available to do things like this.

I think we need to step back and look at the planet as a whole and then redefine the job of the government, do we continue on the current path of corruption, lies and broken promises while being told what to do by selfish and many cases dumb ignorant politicians who change the rules to suit them and those that bribe them or do we figure out what parts of every day life today are or have become needs vs wants, then figuring out what needs everyone should have access to, then from there the governments job is to oversee those needs be it solely regulations or by overseeing their operation and distribution while leaving the wants to the private sector with mainly health/safety regulation oversight and necessary taxation. 

This is a topic I have been thinking about a lot lately and to fully express the thought process it would take me a year of working on it full time in consult with experts around the world and would only take about 10 000 - 100 000 pages to express it all.

TLDR - UBI alone isn't the answer alone but it is a doable first step.

3171,Slick-Fork,alberta,"Kind of. But it’s more complex. I do agree that people make the assumption the government pays it all which is incorrect. 

What you’re missing though is the defined benefit part of it.   I get a contribution match into a plan that I have very little control over. And whatever the plan is worth when I retire is what I get. If I need say $3,000 a month for 20 years when I retire but the plan can only do that for 10 because the market crashed I’m out of luck. A defined benefit pension guarantees that payout and if the plan itself can’t fund it, the company/taxpayers have to make up the shortfall. 

That security is what makes it so costly, it’s the reason that the private sector has gotten out of them as they are a huge benefit to the employees but an enormous liability for the company.  

That’s what makes them priceless. It’s the kind of retirement security only public sector and some very rare private sector employees have.  

They are a MASSIVE add to the salary.  A 10% bump doesn’t come close to reflecting the actual value.  As a quick example. A 60k a year pension at 4% interest requires 1.5million.

Please just take politics out of this and read it  with an open mind using common sense. Not everyone’s situation is the same . 

""Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?

What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?

Is it zero cases?

The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.

Is it a vaccine?

It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.

The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.

We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications.

Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.

We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren’t necessarily safe!

Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?

How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?

You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?

What if October's numbers are the same as August's?

You moved football to spring?

What if next March is worse than this one was?

When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?

I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are strawberries and so is shellfish.

We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.

We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage. Many speed and don't wear seatbelts. 

We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.

Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway?

Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old gas station sushi?

Or operating a chainsaw?

When and how did we so quickly lose our free will?

Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, ""I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the State Fair and go to Church and go hug my Mom in her retirement home.

I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days.

I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else.

I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.

We either get busy living or we get busy dying.

3176,earsnosetail,alberta,"How about the other publications you listed such as Sky News?

That's great that it wasn't oppressive for you but I know for a fact there were protests (once people were brave enough as these were banned and dissenters were arrested) and that your governor(?) has the nickname ""Dictator Dan"". Again, I'm glad you didn't suffer but there are accounts all over the place of those who did. 

I'll explain to you how I see it. Either option (harshest lockdown vs targeted measures) is going to cause suffering and death, albeit for different reasons. You seem to take the position that there is a way to prevent all suffering and death. There isn't. You and I both know that. 

Since covid deaths are counted and documented and broadcasted, they cannot be ignored. The same doesn't go for people suffering or dying due to lockdowns. Whether that's psychological suffering from isolation or abuse, loss of relationship or livelihood or employment or retirement or a future, the effects of anxiety and lack of socialization and education on children. The damage will be done and will affect some people for many years to come. But it will never be documented and broadcasted. So it's less uncomfortable to choose the option where you bury your head in the sand and ignore this side of the coin. 

There's another truth that's even more uncomfortable. Is it moral to take away a young person's future or to put them through suffering to save someone who is very, very old? Death is sad and terrifying and final, so it's easily counted as the very worst outcome. But it's *inevitable*.  And because of the virus, and in many areas of life, preventing *all* deaths comes at a cost. People who are very old are at some point going to die. How much should we hurt others to prevent this, or buy a little more time? It is awful, but the virus forces us to consider this. Whether we  acknowledge it or not, it's a choice we have to make. 

I say this as someone who is an introvert and could do okay during a lockdown, whose job is not at risk, and who lives with a supportive partner and is at no risk for abuse. 

I also say this as someone who has high-risk people in their life that I love very much, and as someone who has lost an elderly relative very close to me. It hurt like hell and still does. I hate that her death was painful, as are many, covid or not. But she was 90 years old, and it was her time. My point is, there's no avoiding loss and pain and difficult choices. I also want to point out that no-lockdown doesn't guarantee that every elderly or at-risk person is going to suffer or die. The death rate has also dropped considerably as a more transmissible but less deadly variant has overtaken the other. Many *nursing home patients* are actually asymptomatic. 

I say all this without judgment as think you're coming from a good place too. Just a different perspective.",gbt4j7o,t3_jr831d,1604994372,1605019572.0,/r/alberta/comments/jr831d/more_than_70_alberta_doctors_plead_for_sharp/gbt4j7o/,2020-11-10 07:46:12,2020-11

Guess how many people you'll have signing up to be teachers for $60K a year and no retirement benefits?

People go into those jobs not to make money, but because they find the work rewarding and there is a promise that they'll be taken care of on the back end.

&gt; Another week, another example of serious issues with retirement homes owned and operated by the Martino families.

&gt; This time, the provincial body that oversees Ontario retirement homes issued two orders that will require the two facilities — one in Hamilton and the other in Niagara Falls — to hire managers approved by the regulator to oversee operations.

&gt; According to the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA): “The registrar believes on reasonable grounds that the licensee cannot or will not properly operate the home without assistance.” A lawyer representing the Martino families says they will comply with the orders.

&gt; To be clear, it’s a good thing the authority is responding firmly to the ongoing problems in these homes. But these are incremental fixes. While they are modestly positive, they don’t get at the central questions being asked again and again by people in Hamilton and across Ontario.

&gt; Why on earth are these people still allowed to operate retirement and long-term-care facilities? How many more violations must there be? How many chances should the bad actors be given? Why are these people still in business?

&gt; These operators have a singularly terrible track record. They owned the Royal Crest Lifecare chain, which collapsed in bankruptcy in 2003 and left Ontario taxpayers on the hook for millions in the end.

&gt; Still, that didn’t stop them from staying in the LTC business. Spectator investigative journalist Steve Buist, who has reported extensively on the Martinos, told us last week that within the past year there have been 120 violations in five homes owned by the families, according to the RHRA.

&gt; In some cases, the homes were in violation of multiple orders to comply. In other words, they were told to fix problems repeatedly and didn’t.

&gt; They also own Hamilton’s Rosslyn Retirement Home, which is now closed. It was the site of the city’s worst COVID-19 outbreak last spring that eventually killed 16 people. More than 60 residents were hospitalized. The home’s licence was eventually revoked after extensive reporting by Buist and others revealed horrifying conditions there.

&gt; Martino-owned Emerald Lodge is in receivership, empty after deteriorating conditions were revealed. Another home, Edgemount Manor, had its licence revoked in June and has been sitting empty since a fire in the fall of last year.

&gt; So again, reasonable people ask: Why are these operators still in business in what is supposed to be a regulated industry?

&gt; The RHRA says it is reluctant to revoke licences because of the “significant impact revocation may have” on residents.

&gt; Fair enough. But at what point does a string of violations and terrible conditions add up to corporate rot and/or incompetence? With a track record like this, how do the authority and the government justify allowing the operators to carry on?

&gt; Ontario’s NDP Opposition, including Hamilton MPP Sandy Shaw, has been aggressively pursuing the government on these questions. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath argues the oversight body itself is part of the problem, that it should dissolved and oversight come back to the government itself.

&gt; That’s a fair point, especially considering a considerable number of RHRA board members have ties to the retirement home/LTC industry. Just as many friends of the Ford government have direct or indirect involvement. The government says it doesn’t tolerate bad behaviour on the part of LTC operators, yet the Martinos are still in business. The government’s tough talk is ringing hollow.",gblxmeh,t3_jqbg7s,1604841153,1604866353.0,/r/ontario/comments/jqbg7s/how_many_chances_do_bad_ltc_actors_get/gblxmeh/,2020-11-08 13:12:33,2020-11

You’re whole statement is framed around the idea that rotational workers are being targeted and treated differently/unfairly. It sucks that your Father can’t see his wife and family but what is the alternative? I get the impression you don’t think the pandemic is “serious” and all these precautions are unnecessary. All your camp precautions are great, but they don’t change the fact that you’re traveling from a place with known community spread into a place without community spread. Do you think it’s fair to the rest of the islands inhabitants to suffer the consequences of a community outbreak because you folks choose to work in Alberta and don’t think you should have to quarantine when you come back?
The problem starts with a poor understanding of the real risk of this sort of pandemic and what it can do to a place with the population demographics that we have in Newfoundland. We are an elderly population, the virus, if given a chance will burn through our old age homes and retirement communities. So Grans the biggest risk, and if killing gran doesn’t concern you, the bigger risk to our healthcare infrastructure should. Once our hospital beds are filled with elderly Covid patients (something that’s currently happening in many US cities who are taking an approach similar to what you’re suggesting) then suddenly we have no more resources to help little Johnny who was in a car accident who normally would have survived.

2.  They aren't proactively looking at ways to reduce long term costs like changing pensions for *new hires* to be DC from DB which would save a lot in the medium to long term.  And despite Calgary's Mayor Nenshi's claims, people would not have to eat cat food in retirement with a DC pension.

3222,Accomplished_Ad6116,ontario,"I visit my county's LTC homes for my work as a librarian - taking robotics and other coding things - generally well received! I do the same in retirement homes now and again, and visit my own remaining grandparent at one as well. LTC is, in comparison to the other facilities, what's the nicest way to put it, horribly depressing?


There are more residents with multiple significant mental and physical issues. There's less money involved (tax-payer funded, residents not paying). Staff seem to be fewer or less interested (100% willing to pin staff disinterest on being overworked and underpaid). And residents appear to have less access to things like rec activities, full-fledged support and therapeutic services, and an overall not-as-nice facility.


Retirement homes (again, in my own anecdotal experience with 20 or so facilities) vary widely based on location (urban, suburban, rural), income levels/savings (wealth/lack of wealth in the surrounding area, their own savings, family money), ownership interest in profits vs. care. My more limited experience with LTC homes (maybe 6 in total, spread across cities and nowhere-villes) presented a more uniform picture. No great spread in 'high quality, lots of money vs low-quality, no money'. Just drab, and awful across the board.


Perhaps the most notable early outbreak was at Pinecrest Manor - a nursing home -  in Bobcaygeon. By the time it was declared over, 28 residents had died, nearly half of all people living there (the total capacity is 65, and I'm not sure if it was full at the onset). 


Nursing homes are in the middle. Like LTC facilities they're for individuals that have significant mental and/or physical issues and require professional 24h care. Unlike LTC, most are privately owned by for-profit companies. 


I'm at work and can't spare the time to find the hard data right now, but by early fall, the vast majority (if I'm wrong, I urge someone to correct me!) of Ontario's COVID-19 deaths in seniors facilities were in private, for-profit homes. Municipally run facilities were quite far down the list, as were not-for-profit facilities as well.


This is what has sparked the lengthy, loud conversation about the nature of for-profit senior care. But there's no single solution, nor even easy-to-comprehend point of view as far as I'm concerned. It's not merely that these places are designed to wring profit at the expense of services levels/resident life and dignity. It's also firmly linked with our society's view of aged family members and how they can best be cared for. 


In a world where many families have two working parents the idea of caring for an older and/or infirm parent at home is difficult at best, impossible at worst. And this is just how we've built things - the same as how we rely on schools to educate and be responsible for kids during the working hours for many people. You can perhaps educate a kid sufficiently online, even if only in the short term, but unless there's a parent handy for kids under a certain age, or for kids that require adult presence up to any age, schools have to be open.


If this all goes on long enough there will be a serious reckoning with one or more of several aspects of how we structure our world:

* Schools as education AND child care
* The value of public education for all
* The role/place of facilities to care for seniors - for-profit, not-for-profit, and publicly funded
* Multi-generational living
* The entire structure of our economy, from jobs to taxes to the role of companies and corporations in society

I've been at it since March and have yet to come up with a coherent position for only myself on even a single one of these issues.

3239,goingfullretard-orig,alberta,"I work in the public sector, for 20 years now. This is from a worker's perspective. 

My collective agreement usually runs on 3-year cycles. Over these decades, I've had pay increases that run along the lines of 0-0-1 or 0-1-2 for pay increments. My salary increases have not kept pace with inflation. My quality of living (measured in monetary terms) has declined over 20 years.

I say this to counteract the idea that public sector employees are lazy and overpaid, as if we sit around sucking on the government tit all day long. I have seen nothing but cuts for the last 10 years, even during the Notley years (partly because our management was not favourable to Notley's politics... even with a willing government, the management structure remains in place, often). We saw cuts and layoffs during the Notley years, largely due to management overexpenditure and bad capital projects.

For example, when I have had to attend a meeting (Pre-COVID), I felt fortunate if there was coffee at the meeting. Once or twice a year, if the meeting ran several hours, there might be food. But, I was happy with that jittery institutional swill that causes cold sweats, if that was all there was. These days, there is no coffee. Maybe it's the same in the private sector; I don't know. 

I contrast this with the perception of private sector jobs where pay increases can eclipse those of public sector jobs. I'm not saying it's a simple either/or. I'm just saying that we don't see this ""Alberta Advantage"" as much in the public sector. I've NEVER had a Christmas bonus or anything else like that. I don't expect one. It's just part of public sector work. Our salaries and generally pretty static, but not keeping up with inflation is pretty bad. Even in good times, like 2005, we didn't see significant pay increases. Just the usual bargaining that starts at 0-0-0 and moves from there.

So, when I hear people like Kenney saying that we have a bloated public sector, that there are redundancies, that there is ""fat""... I just have to laugh. Then, he turns around a cuts jobs by the thousands, ruining people's livelihoods. It's like he's taking out tanking oil prices on the very people who don't want to rely on oil prices for their livelihoods.

Of course, the tradeoff in public sector work is the very things that unions fight for: retirement plans and such. That's the saving grace, for me at least, of public sector work. I can't save much on my pay, but I can count on my pension. Yet, people like Kenney then start going after pension plans, like he did with the ATA and now CPP. It's lunacy. I'm not surprised people are angry.

3245,OriginmanOne,alberta,"That's the thing, I have what I would consider a high paying job but I don't feel like it on payday because my pension takes nearly that much off the top each month. Despite dual incomes, my wife and I have a pretty modest standard of living. 

With a pension, it's not a matter of whether or not you can afford it, because it isn't optional - there is a reason why there are tons of young public sector employees renting with roommates etc despite really well paying (gross) jobs. 

When I think of my friends with 4-6 year post-secondary, the private sector group (journeymen, engineers, business) were buying homes probably 3-4 years earlier than the public sector workers (nurses, teachers, etc). Plus nicer cars, generally higher standard of living despite the fact that, on paper, the two groups probably have similar gross compensation. 

None of this is a complaint. By choosing this career I know that, barring any shocking misdeeds by our government, I have a solid retirement plan.*

3246,gordee78,ontario,"So writing to say: I live in Toronto, in one of those houses I see many people point to as unrealistic and overpriced.  For the record I will say it works for our family.  We have 3 kids now, we love it here.  My wife works at a local hospital, I work from home for a tech company, and our kids go to public school.  I know as a young couple starting out in their careers, it’s hard to imagine .... but it’s very much possible. 

Looking around at our neighbours today it’s true that we are all pretty well off - not because we are supposed millionaires .... we’re all a mix of business people, doctors, sales people, teachers, bar tenders, marketing execs etc.  My neighbour owns a roofing business.  My other neighbour is an ER doc.  But it’s true that most of us are trades with years of experience or university educated.  There’s a good mix from all walks of life.  We are all fortunate to have a few kids, a car or two for groceries etc. 

Personally we “bought” into the market around 2007 after renting for a few years.  Yes we made money on our first house of 5 yrs  (lots of sweat and $$$ to fix it up) and moved to a new house a few blocks away when we expanded to 3 kids. We didn’t have any help from our parents.  We just scrimped and saved and - guess what - worked hard on our careers.  I will say that the best gift both of our parents gave us was no school debt.  So we recognize we’re lucky. 

So here to say that everyone thinks these are all investor homes with Airbnb rentals and quite frankly nothing could be further from the truth in our neighbourhood.  Don’t know if any houses here where foreign rich money is used to buy houses for their kids schooling here or something. We’re all families, with our own money problems — we don’t consider ourselves “rich”.  Yes we start with mortgages in the 25 year range — but hard work just pays off.   We are 11 yrs in, and have about 10 yrs to remaining by plowing any and all extra savings in mortgage pre-payments.  (That’s on top of 3x childcare when my kiddies were younger).  l also manage my own stocks and retirement savings on my own (no pensions or anything like that). 

TL:DR Pick practical university majors, work hard (read long hours, sacrifice) early in one’s career - save and be smart about spending and it is realistic to live and work in great neighbourhoods in Toronto.

3255,AllAtOnce2020,alberta,"I am 100% pro union by principal, but reality is that not all unions are equal and some in fact have corruption within them.  When I was younger it was easy to be anti-union because even though I worked harder and performed better than my senior colleagues, they had first priority protection when layoffs came due to seniority.  I narrowly snuck past being laid off a year after buying my first home, when I probably did twice as much work, better quality, than my seniors.  

I’ve been out of the union for quite some time in management now, but I support unions 100% more so for the bigger picture implications they have on labour rights and pay in society.  The blunt truth is that the general public simply don’t make enough money, and the wealthy manipulate the media so much to make us feel guilty about it... they try to shame health workers and cast them as greedy money grabbers.... the general public need to stand up and demand better pay in general.  Refuse the blaming and shaming and start demanding a wage that will support a moderate lifestyle. People think 100k a year is wealthy and that is a problem... you’d be hard pressed to support a middle class family in 100k in any of our major cities.  Bigger problem is that most people make nowhere near that, and their lifestyles suffer for it... wait till they hit retirement age and have a brutal awakening.

3266,cryptonaut420,britishcolumbia,"&gt; You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.

haha ok sure buddy.

&gt; Yes, right now deaths are low and BC and we’d like to keep it that way. 

Yes. Why do you think that is exactly? Because for the majority of the pandemic, most people in BC were not wearing masks most of the time. Social distancing has never actually been a thing for most normal people outside of grocery stores - except for the doomers who hardcore buy into all of this. Most things have been open since June. Parties have been happening, weddings have been happening, family gatherings have been happening. Nobody actually follows the advice to ""plan ahead, stop the spread"", nobody is actually keeping to their ""safe six"". The plexiglass barrier things at store are just security theatre and likely do essentially nothing unless they go hardcore and enclose off a hole area with a tiny hole to interact with the staff like you are in a place afraid of getting robbed or something. People have been crossing the borders back and forth from all sides, from the U.S in the south, from Alberta in the east, Alaska in the north, plus international flights coming and going.

You can say all of that is basically just anectdotal which wouldn't be totally wrong, and I am not sure exactly how things are in say metro vancouver. But I am just curious, which lockdown measures specifically that were implemented here in B.C do you think are the reason our deaths are so low? What is the best thing we can do to ""keep it that way""?

&gt; But in the US, this virus has killed more people than any virus since the 1918 flu

Estimates of 675,000 deaths from the 1918 spanish flu, total population at the time about 103 million. About 0.6% of the population killed. Fast forward to today, US population is 328 million, massively greater population density as well as mobility (people can move around from place to place way way faster). Currently at 229K deaths, which is only about 0.06% of the population. That is 10 times lower percentage wise than the spanish flu, not even close to as bad. Of course numbers might be different a few years from now when this is all over, but with latest treatments coming out + vaccines, I sincerely doubt it will multiply much further. 

You also have to remember, the average age of death from covid is literally greater than the average human life expectency. IIRC something like 90+% of covid deaths have multiple other serious health conditions, and many cases of people pretty much already being at deaths door and catching covid was just the last thing that did them in. If it wasn't covid it would have been a seasonal flu or something else that they eventually catch that would end up in the same result. We just don't report and write stories on those. Many cases as well of people dieing from other causes, then testing positive for covid after the fact. There is also cases of false positives from tests. Situations that have happened where covid was just ""assumed"" but no actual test given (which to be fair in some cases may be fair assumptions, but you cant say with a straight face that it would be 100% accurate). Situations where people have died from totally unrelated things but still marked down as a covid death. If you do some basic research you will find sources for all of this, and largely from mainstream sources as well. I am not saying that the 229K US deaths number isnt real, or that those deaths are not tragic (every life lost for any reason is a tragedy), but if you think one layer deep than ""omg number is big I am so scared now"", you will realize that based on the demographics of hospitilizations and deaths, it is actually not so scary, and it is also hard to say how accurate the numbers being put out really are considering all the different ways things can be reported. For instance if you are on your death bed dying from cancer, end up testing positive for covid but maybe are lucky and not showing any additional symptoms (dying anyway), well that gets recorded as the same thing as someone who had no previous issues getting covid, having really bad symptoms, getting pneumonia and then dying directly from the disease. Two entirely different scenarios but they are reported as the same thing.

&gt; If you want a source of “long covid”, check out the John Snow Memo which links to a Nature article which discusses it. The memo is signed by dozens of experts in opposition to the right wing Barrington Declaration. Further googling of “long covid” shoud lead you to other results. https://www.johnsnowmemo.com

Read this, basically no new information. Repeating WHO talking points mostly. Admits that lockdowns are bad (but were ""essential""). Recaps bunch of stuff that has happened, cool. Says that we still don't know a bunch of things. Great job doctors. We don't need appeals to authority thanks, capable of thinking for ourselves and looking at the data. Also you claim the other declaration is right-wing and this one is in opposition to it. So you are telling me this is the left wing version? Why should I give a shit about either then?

Couple quotes from your link

&gt; Although lockdowns have been disruptive, substantially affecting mental and physical health, and harming the economy, these effects have often been worse in countries that were not able to use the time during and after lockdown to establish effective pandemic control systems.

Basically they are saying here lockdowns have a ton of negative effects, and the effects are even worse for the countries that wasted their downtime. Makes sense.

&gt; This is a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.

Whenever somebody says this kind of thing and doesn't even elaborate, just expects you to take their word for it, you know it is bullshit. Notice how there is no citation to any counter study proving that herd immunity in low-risk population provides to protection for high-risk population. Just literally take their word for it because we are doctors. Even though there are also plenty of doctors who say the exact opposite. But I guess if they disagree with you they must be right-wing trump supporters and therefore wrong on everything? 

&gt; Any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural infections for COVID-19 is flawed.

&gt; and the endemic transmission that would be the consequence of waning immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the indefinite future

So it turns into more of a common cold like other coronaviruses. We learn to manage it just like other diseases. Why is that not an option? What they are saying here is that we can't stop until there is 100% elimination of Covid. Only 2 viruses have ever been declared eradicated and that is Smallpox and RPV. There has never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus. If you legitimately think that we can 100% eradicate covid and get to 0 cases forever, sorry but that is fucking retarded and you will be disappointed.

&gt; Empirical evidence from many countries shows that it is not feasible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to particular sections of society.

So basically lockdowns don't actually work and the virus can't actually be controlled. This ""declaration"" is fucking stupid haha.

&gt; Once again, we face rapidly accelerating increase in COVID-19 cases across much of Europe, the USA, and many other countries across the world

Not really any major increase in deaths though, funny that. Death rates going down.

&gt; Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic.

Or in other words, print more helicopter money.

Anyways back to your points.

&gt; Empirically those things go hand and hand (eg New Zealand was already mentioned).

New Zealand is a tiny remote island nation and cannot be compared to Canada at all. Also no these things do not go hand in hand. All kinds of viruses spread throughout the population all the time, we do not shut down society over them. Just this one because it is special. Literally all of the negative effects to the economy have been a result of the *response* to the virus, and not the virus itself. If that was true you would see mass amount of people unable to work due to actually being sick, and people dropping dead left and right. Instead it is primarily people from long term care homes, you know those places where people go to live out the last years of their life after retirement from the work force.

&gt; Places who didn’t lock down have often had just as bad, or worse economic impact than those who that did

A) that is not exactly true. B) economies throughout the world are heavily interconnected, one piece effects all the other pieces. So yeah when every major trade partner and all your neighbors are shutting things down, kind of hard to avoid feeling that.

Also BTW the countries that are effected the worst are 3rd world countries that rely heavily on the 1st world for the economies and to do things like I don't know, feed their people? Lockdowns have put something like 100 million+ people in the world on the bring of starvation and have put millions more people into or deeper into poverty, which will likely last generations. Covid zealots truy are the heroes of our time.

&gt; primarily correlated with the severity of community transmission

No it's not. Sweden's economy was still hurt because like every other nation it is heavily intertwined with the rest of the world and it's neighbors, and this is also true culturally as well particularly for the EU. I have seen no evidence from any country that people are being put out of work in large numbers directly from getting sick or dying from the virus. It is always about the *fear* of the virus and the *response* by governments.

Not being able to step through a pay grid is brutal financially, when you have the experience that would otherwise put you at the top of the grid.

On top of all that, many union positions or even management positions have different job titles (eg. Tech I, Tech II, Tech III), or multiple layers of management, so there can be job / salary progression in the event of a freeze.

In my position, there is a single job title that everyone with my qualification has, so basically as soon as you finish residency and get a board certification, you keep the same job title until retirement.

3316,ExtraContribution1,alberta,"Here's some math for those who don't get it. 

The current CPP max contribution is about $5500 (50% from you and 50% from your employer). This will be increasing, but the problems with CPP will be the same. The max you can receive is 14k, but it is actually hard to get that amount ([https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/how-much-cpp-retirement](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/how-much-cpp-retirement)). Your CPP contributions are being maxed if you make $55k+ per year, which is a far cry from wealthy. 

 If we assume the average person works for 40 years, then the effective return from CPP for someone paying the max and receiving the max is only 2.4%, which is not good in any sense. The return looks a little better when you take into account that your employer is paying half (boosting it to 4.8%), but this is still well below what the market returns. Most financial planners will use a number between 4-6% real returns. If you buy your own ETFs, you will be on the higher end of that range, but let's use 4% for the sake of comparison. With a 4% return, you will be looking at a payout of $26400, nearly double what CPP is offering as the conservative scenario. If you can get a more modest 5%, you would be at $38 700, which would be enough to fund most peoples retirement in and of itself. 

So our current system has this massive inefficiency, and the question is why, and how do we change it. The why is simple - past generations under contributed, and are placing the burden on younger generations. This is despite seniors being richer than ever ([https://www.macleans.ca/society/life/seniors-and-the-generation-spending-gap/](https://www.macleans.ca/society/life/seniors-and-the-generation-spending-gap/)), and most being grossly under taxed as they live off their capital gains. Changing the CPP system internally is a tough task that just isn't going to happen, as the pressure of longer lifespans is pushing the system to the limit in the same way that programs around the world are. Canada has put it's head in the sand and not increased retirement age as most of the first world has, planning to increase the burden on the younger generation and offer incentives for postponing CPP withdrawals until age 70. Millennials and Gen Z are being squeezed tighter than ever, due to wage stagnation and (less relevant in Alberta) increased housing prices and cost of living. These generations stand nothing to gain from the current arrangement, and need a complete reset. Localizing our pension plan is a great idea as it gives a fair new deal to younger generations, and it is also good for our  retirees, as we have the youngest demographic in Canada meaning that we have a bigger pool of money to support them with. This really solves a tonne of problems for Alberta.

The real question is how this would get rolled out, and the answer is likely - not well. It is unlikely they adopt a system like Australia where a large portion of the retirement money is invested at the discretion of the individual. It is also likely that that government cuts the employer contribution, negating much of the benefit of switching systems. I think the fear of Alberta mismanaging the investment is overstated, as it is relatively simple to make an equivalent portfolio to the CPP, and index investing tends to beat active management ([https://www.ifa.com/articles/spiva\_-year\_2019\_active\_passive\_scorecard/](https://www.ifa.com/articles/spiva_-year_2019_active_passive_scorecard/)). Now the government might become involved, which could be a problem. All these have yet to be seen, but there is a path where this does not go well depending on the government's rolling out of the program. 

I think it's also worth noting how big of a political hammer this policy is. It basically forces the government to increase retirement age to 70 or even older, which is likely a death sentence for whatever party is in charge. I'm sure the conservatives see it as a good way to elevate themselves federally, but it is also a good way for Alberta to get better treatment from the Confederacy.",g98yagp,t3_jdioqz,1603047788,1603072988.0,/r/alberta/comments/jdioqz/the_ucp_officially_endorses_pulling_us_out_of_cpp/g98yagp/,2020-10-18 19:03:08,2020-10

&gt;Again, you live in a delusion. The average young Canadian who was put out of work is collecting CERB right now and thankful they don't have to be working with the public during a pandemic. 

Collecting CERB isn't sweet, it's going to be difficult to find a job after it's done.

And no, for the most part young Canadians aren't thankful.
Young Canadians include:

- high-school and college/University students receiving subpar instruction

- New graduates/people expecting to graduate into limited entry level jobs

If you work at a restaurant cutting vegetables and got laid off then yeah you ""won"" with CERB. The rest not so much.

Yes...but RRSP contributions reduce your tax bill *today*. Many people benefit from being in a lower tax bracket post-retirement, so the ultimate tax paid on the money is less.

2) Back in the Spring, our LTC facilities and retirement homes were hit particularly hard.

3342,candu_attitude,ontario,"There are a number of factors at play here:

1.  The largest by far is historical mismanagement ranging from bad contracts to not maintaining infrastructure (the G&amp;M article below really explains this).

2.  Green energy contracts helped lower emissions but resulted in excessive prices for wind and solar and the natural gas to back them up because all of the above must be payed for even when they are not generating.

3.  Nuclear plants were expensive to build and because of contruction delays they eneded up going far over budget due to interest that was accrued before they could come online.  Historically this raised power bills (especially since OH mismanaged the payment of this debt) but we are no longer paying for it now that the old Ontario Hydro debt retirement charges have been removed from bills.

4.  Refurbishment of 4 nuclear reactors at Darlington and 6 at Bruce (to extend operational life into the 2060s) contributed a small percentage to increases last year though it is worth noting that u/ruglescdn is incorrect that this is such a large contributer to the price of power as nuclear produces so much power that the billions spent can be spread out over many kWh.  Nuclear is still the second cheapest source of power in the province (beat only by hydro) even after the refurbishment rate increases:

https://www.brucepower.com/we-power-more-for-less/

Nuclear costs more than if we were to generate the same amount of power from natural gas but nuclear is carbon free and renewables cannot meet steady baseload demand so that its the price of having low emissions when you don't have as much hydro as Quebec.  Because of Provinces like QC with an abundance of hydro our power looks expensive by comparison but compared to other developed nations it is still not too bad especially considering we are a world leader in low carbon power.  Even still though, the biggest problem is previous poor decisions not nuclear itself.

Plus physical activity, structure, and social connections are important. Lastly, when we made the decision in August, the rates in our area were extremely low. At that time, we had 1 active case at home, and I think 1 case in hospital.

Checking now, we are up to 20 active case, all at home isolation. Thankfully, we haven't had any deaths in our area since back around April, when it hit (I believe) two retirement homes and killed about 86 seniors. Outside of that, we have had 3 additional deaths since it started.

So we felt pretty safe in returning them to school.

Thankfully their school hasn't had a single case. A school north of us had 2 false positives (siblings) and two highschools in the area have had a case each, as well as a french school further away had a case.

You clearly implied that taking money out of the pockets of working Albertans, suggesting that the Crown shouldn't choose the non-union option because it owes a duty to union workers to employ them. Do you see your position differently here?

&gt;Citation please. Explain to me how diverting money from the pockets of Albertan workers who continue to live, work, play &amp; spend their money in Alberta to multinationals whose only obligations are to shareholders will provide more money directly to the Alberta economy. (Please note: trickle-down, supply-side, neoliberal fairy tales are not sufficient for a citation, as they are neither factual nor direct.)

&gt;Make sure you account for things such as the purchasing power of these people who're about to lose their benefits on the altar of austerity after they retire, since they're about to lose their pensions while also losing the wages they'd need to be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps &amp; invest for their retirement on their own instead of as a collective group.

Consider $2 of profit from Company A taxed at a theoretical rate of 50%. The government now has revenue of $1 to spend on services to the public such as materiel and salaries. Lets say that salaries make up 50% of the cost to provide public services meaning we are now putting back into the economy $0.50 on the $1 we collected in tax revenue vs. leaving the capital in the hands of business at $2 compound with continued investment.

You're diluting value by taking from the growth engines in the economy unnecessarily by justified the effort as a growth mechanism.

&gt;Except that money isn't left inside the corporation. It's used to pay out dividends, buy back stock, fund regressive illiberal political parties built on cronyism &amp; otherwise manipulate the ""free market"" to their own end (as corporations are required to do to act in the best interests of their shareholders), not put into some mythical, farcical ""rainy day fund"" to count on when times are tough.

Storm proofing includes shoring up the balance sheet to increase share price, price-to-book and debt-to-income all of which keep the market from dumping stock. Money doesn't disappear, when a company buys back its stock off the market that money is returned to someone trading on the TSX who would ideally reinvest in another Canadian company rather than exit the market.

Business' don't normally sit on liquidity given the time value of money and use debt as a stop gap to smooth out the peaks and troughs.

&gt;If that was even remotely the case we'd not have spent billions &amp; billions of dollars bailing out profitable companies who've handed out their profits right up until the moment they've come to the government hat-in-hand for a bailout.

You realize the publically traded companies exist to generate value for their shareholders, meaning they will take profits and either,

1. Return them to shareholders in the form of a dividend, or

2. Pay down liabilities to increase share price, or

3. Invest in growth opportunities to increase their book value to increase their stock value.

You seemingly struggle with the concept that yesterdays profits have been allocating accordingly and are no longer available today.

&gt;Gotta love how ""hey, could you try to keep your word from previous contracts &amp; not completely alter the value proposition of being a public servant"" changes to ""thou shalt pay what we demand"" when viewed out your skewed Overton Window. I find it truly telling (&amp; a little sickening) that you're obviously more concerned with businesses folding than people being pushed into poverty.

As I see it we can have some people losing a portion of their take home or we can have a lot of people losing all of their take home. Life is about balance and all I see presented here is demands for more while the world is producing less.

&gt;I'm not sure I follow what you're saying here. Only the government can establish the inherent value of labour?

I say this tongue in cheek, but yes the government establishes the value of labour via the minimum wage.

&gt;A wage that is known to not be livable is somehow the true, right, acceptable value of labour?

A wage that not livable will not attract market participants. The point of contention is that people have different concepts of what's livable and what is not, namely some believe there should be some luxury involved in this definition while others believe that survival is the goal. I lean more to the latter than the former personally.

&gt;Poverty is just a given for some folks &amp; they need to come to terms with it because the government is the only true arbiter of labour's value &amp; anything that lifts you up out of the muck is a concession you should be grateful your employer lets you have? How fucking brokebrained &amp; sociopathic are you?

Poverty is inevitable in any society but can be managed with support programs to circumvent the worst symptoms. This isn't Star Trek, we don't won't symbiotically because nature is neither fair nor just.

&gt;Given that your whole economic outlook is based on disproven neoliberal supply side fairy tales, I don't really place a lot of stock in what your sociopathic bent considers to be ""realistic"".

Really? Well between our two scenarios here whose is closer to reality? You can spend all day here telling me what you want but it doesn't change you take home what you earn.

&gt;The current provincial government does not represent the interests of me, my riding, or my city writ large (quite the opposite).

It seems to me that you're placing your individual interests, as represented by a union, over the wellbeing of all Albertans. You're free to take this position, who am I to say you can't or shouldn't? At the end of the day you need to be honest that you're looking out for yourself first, again this is fine, but that there is no moral superiority for doing so regardless of what you stand up in front of me as an excuse.

&gt;You're obviously projecting your nigh-sociopathic capitalist, me-first viewpoint onto every facet or group in the complex web of relationships that is the current labour market &amp; assuming they'll all act every bit as selfishly &amp; single-mindedly as corporations do.

3357,Runsamok,alberta,"&gt; Its not the governments job to employ people for the sake of employing them.

Where did I say this was the case? Please don't put words in my mouth.

&gt; Tax dollars do more to shore up the economy when held by companies and paid out to contractors / employees through investment than they do diluted in a public sector job.

Citation please. Explain to me how diverting money from the pockets of Albertan workers who continue to live, work, play &amp; spend their money in Alberta to multinationals whose only obligations are to shareholders will provide more money directly to the Alberta economy. (Please note: trickle-down, supply-side, neoliberal fairy tales are not sufficient for a citation, as they are neither factual nor direct.) 

Make sure you account for things such as the purchasing power of these people who're about to lose their benefits on the altar of austerity after they retire, since they're about to lose their pensions while also losing the wages they'd need to be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps &amp; invest for their retirement on their own instead of as a collective group.

&gt; Leaving corporate revenue inside a corporation so it can storm proof prevents a cascade of layoffs that will eventually result in further job losses in the public sector as revenues decline.

Except that money isn't left inside the corporation.

&gt;Tell me, in this pro-union vision of the future who do you expect is going to pay for all of this if we allow companies to fold? This unrealistic expectation that ""thou shall pay what we demand"" has painted unions into a corner where no one comes out a winner. 

Gotta love how ""hey, could you try to keep your word from previous contracts &amp; not completely alter the value proposition of being a public servant"" changes to ""thou shalt pay what we demand"" when viewed out your skewed Overton Window. I find it truly telling (&amp; a little sickening) that you're obviously more concerned with businesses folding than people being pushed into poverty. 

&gt;There is no golden rule for what someone or a group of someone is owed for their labour beyond the floor price set out via the minimum wage. Everything above that is a concession and frankly I so no realistic concessions by the public union space as of right now.

I'm not sure I follow what you're saying here. Only the government can establish the inherent value of labour?

Surely you have an example that goes beyond speculation.

&gt;... pensions that are built on worker contributions, and salaries that are in line with the rest of Canada, keeping provincial average salaries in mind. Uh huh.

While its true that workers pay contributions to a DBPP the employer (i.e. the government) contributes significantly more. My company for example in the private sector provides me with an RRSP saving benefit of 7% of my salary. A public sector employee receives on average an 11% retirement savings benefit.

&gt;But hey - nothing helps a local economy like taking money out of it!

Its often overstated how much the public sector actually contributes vs. the cost to maintain me.

I don't think jobs are going to be a concern for a couple reasons... 1) Manufacturing jobs no longer exist, in Ontario or in NB. Canada's economy has shifted and is now based largely on service and real estate. Those two industries thrive when a population is growing, as NBs population is. So more people will bring more jobs with them, from home building to lawn care to restaurants, jobs will be created by an increasingly growing population. 2) MANY of the people moving here are doing it to retire. They're selling their massivly overpriced homes and bringing their (now much bigger) retirement nestegg with them. This brings us back to point 1, more services for more retirees means more jobs for those still working. 3) Work from home isn't going to be temporary for a large number of people. That cat is out of the bag. Just today Microsoft announced that work from home will be a permanent thing for them.

I know there are many other factors that I'm not smart enough to realize on my own... but again, as someone that recently moved here, and has more than a couple friends back in ontario considering following... this is what I see. I hope I'm right, NB is an amazing province and does still hold onto a much stronger Canadian identity than southern ontario does.

You _can_ glean historical wisdom or perhaps use it as a warning of where we _could_ get to if we don't take things seriously. Or vice versa, take a more calculated risk if we think it will work out okay to keep some things open.

It's also important to look at the _right_ data. For example, is comparing case counts here useful? Do we know what are leading vs lagging indicators? What about numbers of outbreaks? Nobody is charting those. But in the past two weeks we've had a 70% increase in LTC/Retirement Homes/Hospital outbreaks in just the past two weeks alone.

What we had in various jurisdictions in Canada was not a 'lockdown' anyway (thankfully), but rather restrictions and guidance to reduce in-person interaction. That was to ""flatten the curve,"" and that is what we continue doing.

The problem, specifically in Ontario, is that we have the worst of all approaches in that we are restricting the activities of the young and healthy, while *not* implementing 'focused protection' of the people unable to protect themselves on their own. That's how we arrived at the situation where the vast majority of our deaths occurred in institutional settings that are in normal times highly controlled and regulated, namely long-term care homes.

In Ontario, as someone who I guess would be a ""minimizer"" in the terminology of the article, I have to agree that we unfortunately need restrictions to minimize spread because we are evidently doing a poor job of protecting the very most vulnerable, as evidenced by the fact of new positive cases in multiple additional long-term care and retirement homes each and every day.

We can argue about how difficult exactly it is to 'shield' the elderly and vulnerable at each level of community spread. I don't think it's controversial to say that, if we do a better job of it, more community spread should be tolerable while still preserving the health care system. But there doesn't seem to be a high likelihood of us doing a better job of us, going by the last seven months.

Note that the federal government restricts tax-assisted saving by workers who are not in defined benefit plans (which describes 90 per cent of private sector workers) to only 18 per cent of pay. Another instance of “Do as I say, not as I do."" The federal government should be called upon to explain this double-standard or better still, to level the playing field.**

Even though the contribution formulas are similar, the 50-50 cost-sharing mentioned above is applied very differently in the two plans. In the OTPP, the active members and the employers share all costs 50-50. 

.



The two plans are fairly similar in most respects except for cost-sharing. The fact that PSPP does not extend the 50-50 cost-sharing principle to the sharing of deficits makes the PSPP considerably more generous overall.

**In both plans, the contributions being made exceed what private sector workers can contribute to RRSPs or defined contribution pension plans.**

In both plans, the early retirement rules are quite generous. This might have made some sense in a previous era when the country had more potential workers than the economy could absorb. That is no longer the case, and in fact, we are on the brink of a time when workers will be scarce, even with high levels of immigration.

3413,mpetch,alberta,"For over 5 years Alberta has been running a structural deficit. The PBO of Canada estimated we were on target for a trillion dollar debt in one generation and we may never see a corresponding increase in GDP. We have both a spending problem and a revenue problem. The spending problems are mostly in the area of education and healthcare. We need to start reducing salaries (not just freezing) them substantially or get rid of people (hopefully though retirement and attrition). We pay our public sector employees better than most provinces. Gone are the days where public sector employees are being wooed by the private industry and high paying O&amp;G jobs. O&amp;G is on the decline (but far from dead) and we can't pretend the public sector should be immune to the changing job landscape. Jobs that can be handled by the private sector should be moved there. Alberta needs less government, not more.

Find efficiencies, pay less, look at changing how we compensate public sector employees (pensions etc) and try to bring them inline with what the private sector has.

We need to really be taxed. We can tax ourselves more and remain competitive or better than other provinces. Bring in a harmonized PST, bring back health care premiums, increase corporate taxes (In no way believe the corp tax cut was a good idea), and if need be increase personal taxes.

I'm all for investing money in the future. Money that will actually see a real return on investment or real growth in the province. That does in fact include money in O&amp;G but we need to invest in things like a green economy (including nuclear), manufacturing industry, technology industry (especially AI and robotics etc).",g7ftt7w,t3_j41dz9,1601669473,1601694673.0,/r/alberta/comments/j41dz9/moodys_has_downgraded_albertas_longterm_debt/g7ftt7w/,2020-10-02 20:11:13,2020-10

Sadly, you can't just throw warm bodies into a lab.

There's a reason why the certification process is so difficult. You dont want someone who only understands 50% of the job to be doing your testing.

So far, they've thrown more samples at the labs, and the labs have been working longer shifts and expanded the equipment they have for doing the testing (without any increased funding), but there isn't much more they can do without more MLTs.

Possible ways to increase MLTs would include:

* recognize foreign training
* allow certification in single-disciplines (instead of requiring certification in all 5)

&gt;&gt;97 thousand inactive. 71 thousand abandoned.

&gt;No, there isn't a regulator mandated abandonment timeline. There really doesn't need to be, companies will manage their inventories to ensure that their licenses to operate aren't at risk so wells get abandoned organically. 

Given the current state of the economy, the government in power and the fact that there is no mandated timeline for remediation, what are the odds any large operators will lose a license over this?

Zero.


&gt;At the end of the day if the wells you're referring to are inactive sites that are simply awaiting the next steps of asset retirement.

The count of abandoned and inactive wells has skyrocketed over the last decade. If there is no penalty for sitting on them, companies will be content to do just that. 

Want to make me a cash bet that the inactive, abandoned and orphan well counts continue to increase year over year? I'll put $100 on it. 


&gt;No, you can't put asset retirement forever for the reasons I explained previously.

You just said there is no regulation forcing them to remediate within a given timeline.

&gt;Quite eager actually, as their production declines they inch closer to the 1.0 LMR cutoff between bonded and unbonded. If they don't manage it they end up having to find collateral to post for a bond to continue to operate. You'll notice if you pull owner company reports that asset retirement is one the last budget items cut in a down market.

Weird that the inactive, abandoned and orphan counts continue to go up, year over year.

If a company decides that the cost to continue remediation work exceeds what they can conceivably make pulling oil out of the ground...what then?",g700had,t3_j1j2g7,1601330641,1601355841.0,/r/alberta/comments/j1j2g7/albertas_oilsands_owe_canadians_far_more_than/g700had/,2020-09-28 22:04:01,2020-09

&gt;97 thousand inactive. 71 thousand abandoned.

Oh I get what these are now, there are 97,000 inactive wells under owner inventories and 71,000 of them have been abandoned. Only 26,000 need to be abandoned if they are not going to be stimulated and brought back online.

&gt;And, from what I can tell, there is no time frame where the government will actually force remediation, which explains why 15 thousand wells drilled before 1964 still have not been remediated.

No, there isn't a regulator mandated abandonment timeline. There really doesn't need to be, companies will manage their inventories to ensure that their licenses to operate aren't at risk so wells get abandoned organically. It also seems like you don't know that abandoned and remediated are different steps in the process. Namely that an abandoned well is a concrete filled pipe in the ground while remediated is said pipe is cut and capped underground and all well contamination is removed in proximity to the bore. 

At the end of the day if the wells you're referring to are inactive sites that are simply awaiting the next steps of asset retirement.

&gt;So, if a company remains solvent and keeps the abandoned/inactive wells on the books as assets, they could put off remediation forever.

No, you can't put asset retirement forever for the reasons I explained previously.

3469,fuzzzybear,britishcolumbia,"Ridiculously long wait times for joint replacements and surgery.

My girlfriend needed a knee replacement.   She was in constant pain and unable work with her bad knee.  Medical ei only pays a percentage of regular pogie and runs out after 10 weeks.   To add insult to injury, or rather compound her injuries, people who have long wait times to repair one bad knee damage their hip on the opposite side and soon need a hip replacement as well. 

Her knee blew out in January.  We wasted six weeks waiting for waiting to get in for tests,  waiting to see the doctor to get the results and waiting just to hear that nothing will happen for at least 18 months.  Oh yeah,  and she should consider herself lucky as her operation got fast tracked because of her younger age.

We opted to go the medical travel route.  We spent two weeks searching her options and booked a surgery in Belgium.  They could have done her surgery in the end of March but the surgeon wanted to see her x-rays and wanted two specific x-rays from certain angles.   The doctors office refused to release her file to her without her seeing him in an appointment. We had to wait three weeks for this to happen. Because of this wait we didn't get a surgery date until the last week of May. 

The knee replacement cost 8,500 Euro,  roughly $12,250 at the time.   The hospital made us a package that included 24 nights in a  hotel, taxi at our beck and call Evey day from 6 am to 10 pm, medications, rehab 3 times a week while we were there, a guarantee that they would cover any complications she might have from the surgery and, of course,  the prosthetic and operation.     Our total cost was just over $15,000 Canadian.  All we had to pay extra was our airfare and meals.  We bought my mother on the trip,  toured the World War I sites at Ypres and Passchendael, gazed in aw at the city of Brugges and brought home 10 kilograms of Belgium chocolates.  The entire trip cost just under $24,000 Canadian.  For comparison,  a place in Quebec wanted $20,000 for the surgery alone while hospitals in the US started at $40,000 USD. 

The surgeon told us that in Belgium the longest time a person had to wait for a knee or hip replacement was two weeks.   Rotor cuff and ACL surgeries were done within a week.  He said that at one time they were as inefficient as we are now.   They managed to overcome this by making each hospital dedicated to one specific field of medicine.   One hospital specializes in  knees and hips.   One hospital specializes in  acl and rotator cuffs, one hospital specializes in ear nose and throat.   Another specializes in heart and lungs, while others treat cancer. 

This allowed them to streamline their surgeries much like an assembly line.  So much so that they have space to operate on foreigners.   My girlfriend had her surgery in May.   She was back to work in July.   She got a call from a British Columbian surgeon's office to make an appointment to review her case the following February, and was told that her earliest date for the surgery would be in June. 

My friend is a millwright. He tore his rotator cuff while on holidays and was unable to work.  He could not get in to see a surgeon here in BC for five or six months.   The surgeon's office would not give him a date, instead they said that theyd call him when the time comes.   He was 61 years old then.   His medical ei ran out and his company's disability coverage refused to pay him because he did not have a firm return to work date or a doctor's confirmation that he was permanently disabled.  They tried to force him into  early retirement at a reduced rate.   His doctor told him that if he retired then his surgery date will be pushed back in favor of people who are working. 

He looked into private surgery here in British Columbia.   He was looking at $12,000 - $14,000 here in bc, with a three month wait time.   I told him about our trip to Belgium which he also chose to do.   He had them put a package together and went there three weeks later.  His total cost for the trip and two weeks in Belgium was only $10,000 Canadian.  This included airfare,  surgery, and all other expenses.

""So do current working-age Canadians need to worry about their CPP pensions? The short answer is no. Workers will definitely get a CPP pension. The ultimate cost of CPP pensions may end up being a little higher than what the chief actuary has estimated but it also might be a little lower.

3489,FalseWorry,alberta,"&gt;My original comment was ""Sure, once we fix the wealth gap.""

&gt;Not sure how you wandered down the ""income"" rabbit hole based on that, but here we are.

But we can't, we don't have a wealth tax we have an income tax.

&gt;The Global article is actually based on this study, not the one you originally linked:

The data is identical, the study you mention references said data.

&gt;So we have a tremendous concentration of wealth at the top of the pyramid. When 87 families have more between them than the collective population of THREE ENTIRE PROVINCES, its safe to say the system is broken. Want to bet those 87 families pay less tax as a percentage of their increased wealth every year than I do from income tax on my 9-5 job?

How many times do I have to say we tax income not wealth before it sinks in?

&gt;When billionaires are taxed less than the middle class, that system is fucking broken. They also hold disproportionate political influence, constantly rigging the system to amass more wealth and pay less tax on it.

Everyone gets taxed under the same system for heaven's sake.

&gt;As for how to fix it, how about a wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million?

You're more than welcome to propose it but I would envision that you'd end up with a lot of offshore wealth and not significantly further ahead than where we are now.

&gt;How about scrapping the 50 percent break on capital gains?

You realize that this will impact everyone right? From the wealthy you're looking to victimize to the low income earner trying to save for retirement.

&gt;How about an inheritance tax? There are a lot of options that don't involve taking people's property.

What would be the moral basis for it? The wealth was taxed extensively while the deceased was alive. What right does the government to more of it simply because they're dead?

Taxes while useful aren't the path to prosperity, we can't tear people down to drag ourselves up. That's wrong.",g68i8gw,t3_iwkbhx,1600797458,1600822658.0,/r/alberta/comments/iwkbhx/a_sentiment_that_might_be_echoed_here_in_our/g68i8gw/,2020-09-22 17:57:38,2020-09

3506,theartfulcodger,alberta,"""*Looks* like"" a spoiled brat. Lol. Let's review, shall we?

Only child; born into a smug and self-satisfied bedroom suburb full of corpulent DINKS and NIMBYS. 

Daddy financed his expensive education at a private and exclusive high school, a private and exclusive prep school and a high-priced, private American college (until he flunked out). 

That's the time when, as an eighteen year old living off his daddy's monthly remittance cheques, he boasted to CNN that he wasn't *ecktually* a navel-gazing philosophy student, he was *rilly* an ""anti-abortion activist"". Of course, he didn't let on to the CNN interviewer that he was in fact a foreign *agent provocateur*: an alien allowed into the US only to study, but who was instead deeply engaged in controversial political agitiation to deny his *American* classmates their reproductive rights.

When Jason's student visa was revoked and he was forced to return to Canada, he took on his one and only private sector job, ever. But because of his rank incompetence as the noob director of the Alberta Taxpayers' Foundation, it took barely a year for him to run it into the ground, and for its well-heeled founder to finally snap his chequebook shut and scream ""Enough! Get out!"" Unfortunately for the ATF, by then the financial damage Kenney had caused was irreparable, and the organization was dissolved.

Then, almost overnight, Jason switched from wanting to *troll* the government to wanting to *be* the government. So he convinced his long-suffering father and his former ATF sugar-daddy to finance his first election campaign; because, Lord knows, *he* didn't have any money. 

In fact, Kenney never actually earned a steady paycheque for himself until ten years after he flunked out of uni. When, at the age of *29* he finally became an MP, Momma and Daddy Kenney must have been *so* proud of their little late-bloomer. Finally, Little Jason could afford to buy his own Kraft Dinner and KitKats, all by himself! He was all grown up!

Edit: Oh, yeah - and for most of his years as an MP, in order to collect a generous housing allowance, Kenney *claimed* to maintain a permanent residence in his mom's nonexistent basement -  in a Calgary retirement community limited to those over 65. In fact, to keep collecting, he continued to claim that he still ""lived with his mom"" for *more than a year* after she actually sold off her suite, and was moved into a single room in an assisted living facility for the elderly.

So it ain't the way he *looks* that is the defining element of your characterization.",g5qsg82,t3_iv5q9e,1600463517,1600488717.0,/r/alberta/comments/iv5q9e/kenney_to_trudeau_alberta_wants_65_billion_now/g5qsg82/,2020-09-18 21:11:57,2020-09

---

I live in [small town, small province]. Do you think bleeding your small town away by chasing away new folk is how you improve your services? Services are stretched super thin because everyone is moving out of [small town] so the services are cut. EVERY [small town] has been shrinking for decades, and you will continue to see services cut. Houses are on the market for *years* or *decades* which is not the sign of a thriving community, and is not going to encourage the government to provide you more services, no matter how much you complain.

By having new people move in, there is need for the services again and funding will return. Old people buy food, clothing, medical service, entertainment, farmers goods, etc. The increased need for medical services will bring on more funding. Your medical services are not cut because you have *too large* a town, it is because they don't serve a large enough population. And let me tell you about old people: they spend money! This means business that were previously dying because everyone was moving out can stay open; but I suppose it is better to let the [small town] die out and your home grown local businesses die so that you can keep out some old people.

Some of these newcomers start businesses that the [small town] old timers decided were not worth keeping open, and so they actually improve your [small town]. You remove all the outsider owned businesses in our [small town] and suddenly you have to drive 50-85 km to get more than basic groceries. That's the kind of investment you seem keen on chasing away. Additionally, I know people who have small businesses in our [small town] which thrive when more old people move in, which means more business for other community businesses as well.

You think NS cannot afford to be treated like a retirement community, but in so doing you are chasing away everyone who could serve that community, and you. You are chasing away the business and people investment that will result in increased government investment in your town. So [small town] will continue to wither away and you will continue to lose services; but at least there aren't any darned outsiders around ruining it for you.

&gt; Unions leaders are calling on the province to better protect whistleblowers, warning that front-line workers won’t speak out at a commission investigating the wildfire spread of COVID-19 in Ontario’s long-term care homes.

&gt; Their call comes days after a local nurse spoke out about being fired by her temp agency after blowing the whistle on conditions at the Rosslyn Retirement Residence.

Rosslyn retirement is the facility that had 100% of their residents infected within a week of the start of their outbreak, they had to evacuate the facility, [and then they left a resident behind](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/05/20/covid-19-coronavirus-hamilton-latest-news.html).

Reposting my comment from when Rosslyn first made the news

&gt; Insane, now almost certainly criminal levels of incompetence from the management here. 100% of the residents and 20+ staff (close to 100%?) have been infected.

&gt; [On April 15](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/05/15/crisis-at-hamilton-retirement-home-with-covid-19-outbreak-residents-being-transferred-to-hospital.html), this retirement home (not a Long Term Care facility) was inspected by public health. They were found to be failing to comply with public health orders including not having any isolation plans for sick residents.

&gt; The local medical officer of health said they fixed the problems.

&gt; A month later, they declare an outbreak (May 10). May 12th, they were again inspected by public health, and cited for the exact same failures (the same ones they said they fixed), plus more.

&gt; Within a few days later, the facility was emptied (OR SO THEY THOUGHT), [100% of the residents infected](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/05/16/covid-19-hamilton-latest-news.html), most of them admitted in hospital, at least one dead, and almost two dozen staff infected.

&gt; According to the order document issued to the Rosslyn, an April 15 on-site audit found the facility “inadequately prepared to respond to a case or outbreak of COVID-19, including; lack of sufficiently detailed outbreak response plan; lack of written policy and processes for in-home isolation of ill residents, and/or physical distancing.”

CPP will also be reduced for early retirement.  And take it at 60?  You must have health issues or doubts about longevity? All mathematical studies say you should defer it otherwise.

We'll be returning early as well, and also with DB plan, so always curious about others numbers who are similar.",g4tb71m,t3_iqi600,1599823786,1599848986.0,/r/ontario/comments/iqi600/so_the_top_demanding_career_prospects_in_ontario/g4tb71m/,2020-09-11 11:29:46,2020-09

How did you forget to include parking and insurance in your monthly breakdown? I assume you have tenant and vehicle insurance right? Home and vehicle insurance for me in nowheres ville is about 240$ a month.

3575,FizixMan,ontario,"In addition to /u/grabbinpills's comment, a [far greater proportion of people that were getting sick were older back in the first few months of the pandemic.](https://i.imgur.com/Kbb0NQV.png) ([source](https://russell-pollari.github.io/ontario-covid19/)) In addition, more people were hospitalized preemptively. (Also, my understanding is, at the time, elderly that were diagnosed with COVID were sometimes moved out of the LTC homes they were living in and into hospitals in order to better quarantine/isolate them from the rest of the vulnerable populations. Though I don't have a source for that, that's just what I heard.) Now that we know how to better treat it, I imagine fewer people are hospitalized that don't need to be, and those that are might be treated with more efficacy and have a quicker time to discharge.

But also, perhaps more significantly, hospitalization generally lags behind infections for a bit. It's hard to tell from the scale of the graph (of which _I'm sure_ /u/raslghh has no purpose behind) but since our new infections/active case lows a month ago, hospitalizations have increased over 50% (+/- depending on what datapoints you pick.)

Probably the most critical factor is that we've gotten our LTC, retirement homes, and hospital outbreaks under control. On [May 10th](https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-05-11.pdf) we had 245 LTC homes, 95 retirement homes, and 73 hospitals with outbreaks. Meanwhile today, [September 10th](https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-09-10.pdf), it's 23 LTC homes, 22 retirement homes, 2 hospitals.

I'm sure no doubt people will try to spin this as ""End the lockdown!!!1 No more masks!!!1"" but the reality is that they are a bit linked.

3600,EtOHMartini,ontario,"Fair questions. I hold a PhD in Educational Policy.

Part of my dissertation was on school funding and something called the 
Demographic Allocation which supplies extra funding to the boards with the neediest 40% of schools.

You're right, there are a lot of retired teachers out there. The problem is that you would have to change a lot of rules to bring them out of retirement. They are earning a good pension which prohibits them from working more than a certain number of days. So you would have to get the pension to waive their rules to enable them to work. You would have to fast track the reactivation of their teaching certificates and vulnerable sector background check. Then you actually have to convince them to work during a pandemic, get them to apply, and hire them. 

As for alternative spaces, it may be possible in some cases. Use of high schools means you have access to the board's computer network, caretaking staff, and facilities like surveillance systems, PA systems, etc. You are basically giving high school kids the short end of the stick, but whatever. If feasible, I would have put grade 11/12 online and have grades 7/8/9/10 in the high schools so that you don't have to worry about the size of furniture, drinking fountain and toilet heights.

Third party site rentals are messy. Who does the caretaking and cleaning? Who pays for repairs if things get damaged? Can you control public access to make it safe for kids? Can the wifi handle 100 kids working simultaneously? How do parents call in to get their kids in an emergency? Can school buses access the site? Will the landlord allow this to go on indefinitely? Can the teacher leave their classroom setup after hours or weekends or will the banquet hall/community center be used by others in the evenings or weekends?

3615,Ilsem,alberta,"There's pretty much zero demand for teachers in Alberta and most other provinces right now, especially in urban areas. Most teaching positions have had up to 400 applicants, or so I was told. Even with several years of teaching and volunteer experience with children and teens, including 6 years of substitute teaching, a science and math degree, and having put out close to 40 applications a year, I've only had 3 interviews in the past 6 years. Only one lead to a temporary contract that didn't result in a continuing contract. School boards are laying off hundreds of teachers this year, who are all going into the applicant pool due to funding cuts by the UCP. The competition is worse than it's ever been.

The reality is that most provinces are flooded with teaching candidates. Many former/practicing teachers don't seem to realize how much the landscape has changed in the past 4 years or so. For a picture, check out this [article](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/way-too-many-teachers/) from 2011 which includes this:

&gt;The effect of an ever-growing pool of job seekers is reflected in a 2010  survey by the Ontario College of Teachers (PDF), the provincial body  that licenses teachers. Most neophyte teachers aren’t getting full-time  jobs, or anything close. In 2006, 30 percent of teachers in their first  year after graduation were either unemployed or underemployed. By 2010,  that proportion had more than doubled, to 68 percent. Nearly one in four  new teachers got no work at all, up from just three percent in 2006.

That's not just the reality in Ontario. It's the same pretty much across Canada. You can increase your chances by working for rural boards, but even many of them are saturated with applicants now. You have to go into the deep rural areas to have even a remote chance of getting work.

If you decide to stay the course and get lucky enough to get onto a board as a substitute, it's pretty terrible. In the Calgary area, subs are generally paid $220 a day with no guarantee of work. The best school board I've seen so far manages to get its subs an average of 2.5 shifts per week. That's around $2200 a month, and you'll only get that 9 months a year. You lose 2 months of income for July and August, and typically around another month across September (new school year means very few illnesses and meetings) and December (Christmas break), along with assorted other time off like spring break. And that's a good school board. I've known subs who have to join multiple school boards to get even close to that. The CBE is notoriously awful for that because of how their dispatching system works. My wife worked for them for a year and was lucky to get a shift a month with them. You also get no benefits, and although you have the option to pay into the Alberta Teachers Retirement Fund, I've never made enough money to do so.

You might hear other people say things like ""you might have to spend a couple years on the sub board"" and ""science is always in demand"". Maybe that was true once, but it's not anymore. My family has been living on the edge of poverty for 6 years now because we blindly believed what everyone was saying about how subbing was just a temporary step toward a permanent teaching position. I love working with children and have worked hard to be the best teacher I can be, but there are deep systemic problems with the hiring process for teachers and I'm tired of fighting it. Even when teachers and students have said they'd recommend me to their principal for future positions, I didn't even get a phone call for my application. Nepotism is rampant, and the applicant pool is so massive that getting a teaching position is akin to winning the lottery. My advice is not to bother, but it's your decision. If you decide to go the same route as I did, realize that you could spend your entire career rolling the dice and hoping for a position and never get one. But who knows, maybe you're luckier than I am.",g3yacqi,t3_im3z8y,1599197471,1599222671.0,/r/alberta/comments/im3z8y/are_high_school_science_teaching_jobs_in_demand/g3yacqi/,2020-09-04 05:31:11,2020-09

Our winter season is so bizarre some years. The first year I lived here, it didn't snow until about Christmas day. Sometimes we might get a dump of snow in early November 🤷‍♂️

The other towns/cities you listed are honestly all pretty lovely, in my experience. Kamloops has the biggest population, so you'll find more services/attractions. (Although West Kelowna is adjacent to Kelowna, so it's noticeably 'busier' - the traffic is a tad nasty at times).

Nelson is really cool because the community strongly favours local food and business. There are almost zero fast food and chain restaurants in the town. I think there are just a few near the Walmart, but that's it. Someone once told me that a Starbucks tried to open up in town, and there was a town vote with a huge turnout voting it down. Kind of neat. Very cool vibe there. Super pretty part of the province, too. Bit far away from any major centers, though. Kamloops is an excellent 'hub city', in that we're kind of right in the middle of everything. Vancouver is a bit of a jaunt, ~3.5 hour drive, but it's still pretty accessible if you want to check out some big city stuff or concerts for a weekend away.

I've only driven through Rossland, it's pretty small, but it seems like a super cute town. Golden is a bit touristy.

3640,Bag-o-toys,ontario,"District School Board of Niagara.  As for new hires to save money, not really.  Understand when a contracted teacher is surplussed from their school, they only lose their position in that school, not with the board.  The 2 year moratorium on bumping new hires into the school has been in place for quite some time.  It ensures that someone who has decided to move somewhere, gets a few years without worry of being hired at a school, and a few months later getting unhired and their previous position has already been filled, so they are left in limbo.  This impacts transfers, where contracted teachers move from one school to another, and it also impacts newly contracted teachers (the new hires).  So at my wife's school, they had a number of staff leave at the end of last year, due to retirement and transferring out because their administration is a complete shit show.  Those positions were either filled with transfers, and then if not enough transfers were available, through new hires.   Now if there are surplus, none of those new people who were hired into the school can be surplussed, so they go up the seniority list.  So if someone from my wife's school has to leave it will be someone who has already taught at the school for a number of years now.  So within the school it would change the payroll, but not within the board.   

What will impact the board, and ultimately the provinces budget is what is no doubt going to be a large cohort of people retiring before this school year starts.  I was out for coffee with a friend who said their best friend worked in HR at one of the local boards and they were getting inundated with intentions of vested teachers to retire as of the end of August.

Can anecdotally confirm. I've been doing some of the testing at long term care and retirement homes for staff. The province made it mandatory for all staff, once, back in April/May. 

Since then they've left it up to the facilities with a directive that says staff ""should"" get tested every two weeks for surveillance but gives no mechanism for facility management to compel staff to undergo what is still a controlled medical act with PHIPA/HR protections. 

Either way, we've been doing pop-up testing at LTC and retirement homes. In May-June we were having ~75% of most facility's staff voluntarily get tested with us. Over the last few weeks it has been down to ~30% at some facilities. 

There are ~100k LTC staff in Ontario, and if they're under ministry directive that they ""should"" be tested every two weeks, that's a significant portion of our test capacity.",g3160ni,t3_ihlndc,1598542907,1598568107.0,/r/ontario/comments/ihlndc/august_27th_ontario_reports_118_new_cases_1_new/g3160ni/,2020-08-27 15:41:47,2020-08

- I would support a PST if they cut public service wages across all sectors including municipalities.

- A land transfer tax should be introduced to generate new revenues.

- Provincial health premiums should be brought back; it was stupid for Stelmach to have dropped them.

- Corporate tax cuts will not bring Alberta back to better times, as they will improve the bottom line of larger companies.  Those companies are unlikely to re-invest those profits in jobs and facilities as we have already seen.

- All new public service pensions should be converted to DC from DB to save costs going forward.  And, no Mayor Nenshi, a DC pension instead of DB doesn't mean people will have to eat cat food in retirement.

In the OTPP, employees contribute 10.4 per cent on their earnings below $57,400 and 12 per cent on earnings over $57,400 (which we refer to as 10.4/12). Contributions under the PSPP are a little lower at 9.49/11.67 (same threshold of $57,400).

3666,tiberria,NovaScotia,"I think we also need to see the breakout for what percentage of this travel - by where they are coming from - is business vs personal/tourist related travel.  The business travel is not likely going to come back any time soon, because most prudent businesses are going to be extremely reluctant to physically send someone on a trip out of province or country unless it is 100% unavoidable and can not be done remotely/through conference or Zoom calls.  If anything, I think that business travel is likely to never rebound to pre-COVID levels, even if all the safety related concerns are addressed, because being forced to find solutions through remote tech during COVID, a lot of businesses will realize that a lot of it is entirely unnecessary.  They will just see it as an avoidable expense that they can cut way back on in the likely rough economic times we will see coming out of this.  If both US parties can make holding their presidential nomination conventions virtually, you have a hard time thinking of too many things that would make business travel mandatory anymore.

Also, even if it was the start of the tourism season, I can't see the non business tourist based traffic/spending rebounding to pre-COVID levels or anything close to it even if borders were wide open.

\- Lots of people have lost their jobs and have no income to be taking tourism trips.

\- Lots more people are worried about the future of their jobs or their retirement funds, etc., so consumer confidence is way down, which will drive discretionary spending like tourist travel down.

\- Even if do decide to travel here, the pandemic related restrictions and closures and just general concern for safety means they are probably going to spend less money and go less places than the historical tourism data suggests.

I don't think we can count on going back to 2019 numbers even on the tourist travel side of it - it's probably going to be way less.

And, on top of that, in any calculation about reopening, we have to factor in the health care costs of driving more COVID cases/more of an outbreak - that's going to cost the province money, and cost lives.

The bottom line is that I think the tourism industry is just dead in the water until there is widespread distribution of a vaccine or the pandemic plays its course - it's probably a dead industry until the 2022 tourism season at the absolute earliest.  I think government should just accept that reality instead of making things worse by trying to mitigate it through openings that cause even more expensive problems, and should instead focus on how to support the people caught up in this.  Bottom line is, time and money would probably be better spent giving tourism industry employees re-training to transition them to another industry or supporting them in transitioning to another career path.  It's not going to be back any time soon, and when it does come back, it's not going to be anything like it was before the pandemic, and won't be for a very long time.",g1s1ost,t3_ia7xud,1597616435,1597641635.0,/r/NovaScotia/comments/ia7xud/deep_dive_into_tourist_s_in_reference_to_the/g1s1ost/,2020-08-16 22:20:35,2020-08

3668,GrabbinPills,ontario,"&gt; [The largest operator of private nursing homes in Canada](https://outline.com/9L37y7) has received millions in federal wage subsidies for its home healthcare subsidiary while it has also given millions to its shareholders in monthly dividends.

&gt; Extendicare said its home-care subsidiary, ParaMed, applied for and received $21 million under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) after it “experienced significant declines in demand for home health care services during the pandemic.”

&gt; Extendicare executives said the subsidiary will be applying for more wage subsidies and they expect the next payment, if approved, to be “in line” with the $21 million already received.

&gt; Revenue, however, was up for Extendicare as a whole, driven, in part, by government funding to help combat COVID-19 and growth in their retirement living operations.

&gt; The company has paid close to $20 million in total dividends since January, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Fatalities due to covid are being investigated as fatalities. Time will tell on how the ministry pursues this, but they're collecting their evidence.

If we acknowledge that dying to COVID-19 is a complex situation involving a series of factors that we don't truly understand yet, then at some point we have to acknowledge preventing exposure points where possible is the crux of 25 2 h.

Where do you think money spent on health care goes? It doesn't just disappear.

Let's talk about wages here. I believe the majority of all government spending is wages, after all.

When a doctor or a nurse, or even a hospital janitor receive their paycheque, what do they do with it?

The answer is they do the same thing everyone else does. To name a few things, they pay their bills, buy food for their family, save for a rainy day or retirement, and so on.

And each transaction they make moves money from them to someone else. When they pay their Enmax bill, Enmax uses the proceeds to pay their employees. When they pay their cable bill, Shaw uses the proceeds to pay *their* employees, and so on.

One of my brothers is in school in a different country. He can't legally work on his student visa. 

How is it fair to my father, to all of a sudden lose a pretty sizable chunk of his anual income while corporations across Canada are paying 15% *or less* with all of the tax exemptions and loopholes?

Tax the corporation, not the individuals. If corporations were paying the same amount in taxes as people were then there would be a massive amount of money going back into the government.

""Incorporated physicians who do not want to participate in Canada Pension Plan Contributions can pay dividends instead of salary.""

Nearly every physician in Alberta will be incorporated. Some might pay into CPP if they take a salary. Most will pay dividends instead.

&gt; I don’t have a link to my doctors pension lol. All I know is he’s talked about it lately (on the phone because no office visits) as we got on a conversation about the UCP changes and he mentioned he’s not leaving Alberta and something about his pension plan.

I have no idea what this would be. There is no pension for Alberta physicians. He might mean he can't afford to retire and his ""pension plan"" is working. You get nothing in retirement as a physician. Many refer to their pension as working until they are in their 70s as a joke, of sorts.

3703,stephenBB81,ontario,"If we cancelled the School year this poses a lot of challenges.

1:  What will it do for the Students?

2: What will it do for the Work force with Elementary School aged children?

3: What will it do for the Education Staff?

&amp;#x200B;

A1:  The Students will be ""behind a year""  but really that metric is just some societal goal of when a person should learn a specific thing.  It is arbitrary and wouldn't be long term detrimental from an Education standpoint.  But from a social and mental health standpoint School is a major factor in social interactions for kids, we no longer have families with 5-10 siblings living near other families with 5-10 siblings so kids can interact with their own age group. A continued school closure is forcing isolation from forming bonds with peer groups, this will hurt those only children from poorer backgrounds far more than those with siblings and those who can connect digitally with their friends. 

We also come into a Society divide.  The have's and have not's,  Regardless of school starting my kids will be getting a lot of academic work given to them,  each has a cellphone, and each will have access to a computer at 11 &amp; 9yrs old,  they will be doing Prodigy math, they have workbooks in Both French and English that have Audio assist components, and we are already talking to a recently retired Teacher about 2 days a week outdoor lessons with the kids, possibly partnering with another family who has similar aged kids.  This is not possible for many families so without school we are creating the education divide similar to that of the US where those with money have far far better access to education.  

A2:  Our society is built around the majority of adults who have kids between 4-12 yrs old to have a publicly funded place for their children to go during the day to allow them to contribute to society, our housing market, and service industry rely on 2 working parents as the majority of the population sadly.  Our government debt load has been tied to a percentage of our GDP, and our GDP is heavily propped up by Residential and commercial developments having very high values.  So we aren't going to see any real action in bringing that down so one parent could stay home.   Without a place to put kids parents will need to stay home, have grandparents take their kids, and many other short term solutions that put their housing situation at risk.  It isn't good for economic recovery and it isn't good for a healthy outlook if we have a massive population devastated. 

A3:  This is really the easiest question,  We would have to Furlough the Front line workers and realistically look at hose the boards are built,   Laying off 99% of the Teachers/School based support staff for a year would put a lot of people in financial troubles similarly outlined above.   It would also pose some contract challenges and some retirement challenges with how contributions take place during a time of furlough.

3714,QueueOfPancakes,ontario,"&gt;Yeah, they are going to give up their nice pension and retirement years to work during a pandemic

Why would it mean giving up their pension? It would be extra money on top of their pension.

&gt;Many are old enough to be quite high risk of complications or death if they contract Covid.

Many teaching positions will be online. Those should be prioritized for teachers most at risk from the virus. This would mean the recently retired teachers would be working from home, online.

&gt;Also, where are we even going to put these teachers? Most schools are bursting at the seams with many portables already.

There are many options. Other countries have already figured out how to safely reopen, so we can simply do the same. As you already thought of, community buildings are a great option. We can also reopen closed schools, hold classes outdoors when weather permits, use commerical space (Denmark used hotels and conference centers as they are quite empty right now), and if needed, we should prioritize elementary students for in person learning. High school students are better able to use online learning, require less supervision at home, and they are at greater risk of spreading the virus. This means that, if needed, we can close some high schools and use that space for elementary students. (We should prioritize in person learning for special needs high school students as well).

You wouldn't need to move kids from place to place though. A class would stay in their location. You wouldn't have them in a community center in the morning and the school building in the afternoon for example.

For bussing with covid (regardless of school plan), I'm not sure. I haven't been able to find much information about how other countries have done bussing. One obvious measure would be to have ""walking school buses"" everywhere it was doable. But I'm sure our experts can figure out a solution.

I know for years it has been nearly impossible to land a full time teaching contract, so you would think that there should be qualified people out there. I admit I don't fully understand why we have had a local teacher shortage over the last couple years.

I know two people who have teaching degrees, but who have taken up a different career years ago, mostly due to the lack of jobs at the time. I doubt that they would give up their established jobs to go back into teaching now - given all the concerns around COVID and the fact it would likely be a temporary position anyway.

And then there is the issue of retirements - I wouldn't be surprised if there are more than a few teachers who are close to retirement age that decide just to retire early - I think that's probably what I would do in that situation.

I'm not a fan of the current government, but I don't know that we would have ended up with a vastly different plan had the liberals or NDP been in power. The situation has been evolving so quickly that it has been nearly impossible to make plans for months ahead. As you say, they would have had to start hiring more teachers in April to even start getting ready for September.

3722,skidooer,ontario,"&gt; You grew up in a retirement town.

When I was a kid it definitely was. Today, it's a trendy tourist town that also is home to a couple of pretty successful tech companies. Kind of like Toronto, but on a much smaller scale. Retirement towns don't attract the rich and famous. Don't be silly.

&gt; Do you have tens of thousands of people travelling into your town every day for their jobs

Tens of thousands, no. Proportionately, yes, unquestionably. Many people who work there could never afford to live there. Maybe the ones who work for the tech companies.

&gt; Houses aren't being built in Toronto, at all.

Like this second, or within some reasonable timeframe of the past? Because I can point to some almost brand new detached houses in Toronto, easily.

&gt; Are you stupid?

Yes. Obviously. I'm using Reddit, aren't I?

&gt; Your town chose these rules, Toronto didn't.

Toronto is laughably sparse for a major city. Manhattan has 66,940 people per square mile. Toronto, just 11,226 people per square mile. If you have a housing problem, why aren't you actually putting some real effort into building new places to live? There is an *incredible* amount of space to work with. It is practically rural there.

Answer: Too much red tape. Choose some rules that eliminate that red tape, your housing problem disappears. Same as everywhere else.",g0mf7xu,t3_i4myv2,1596758952,1596784152.0,/r/ontario/comments/i4myv2/can_we_stop_being_so_mean_to_each_other_when/g0mf7xu/,2020-08-07 00:09:12,2020-08

Do you have tens of thousands of people travelling into your town every day for their jobs, but then pull that money out and spend it in another location? How about a constant stream of condo buildings, where the entry price is a nice and easy 750k? Houses aren't being built in Toronto, at all. Are you stupid? I don't know why the rest of Ontario has this fucking victim complex in relation to Toronto, but it's just sad. Any time someone talks about a Toronto issue, you mouth breathers come out in droves to nail yourselves to the cross.

3724,ASentientHam,alberta,"Willing to bet that the boxes are full of old student work.  We’re required to keep student work for 5 (or is it 7?) years for auditing purposes.  If Alberta Education wants to know how we decided on a mark for students, we need to provide evidence for our decisions.  So there are spaces all over the school packed with boxes like this.  Often they are fire hazards, falling hazards, etc.  

It’s not anyone’s job in particular to manage them in my experience.  So as a responsible teacher, you find a spot to put your boxes each year, you tape them up and label them with a marker.  Of course 5 years later no one has the time to sort through piles of boxes to dispose of the oldest ones securely, since you can’t just throw them out due to FOIP considerations.  Furthermore, when a teacher leaves the school, either by transfer or retirement or whatever, the boxes need to stay at the school.  It’s pretty common for me to find boxes from 10-15 years ago from teachers I’ve never heard of.

It's not something I experienced personally, but NDP-supporting friends of mine in various government ministries did. I can't attest to how widespread it was.

I don't work for a ministry, but I'm still a provincial employee, and as partisan as I am, I do my job to the best of my ability, and so do the friends I'm speaking of.

Just because nearly everyone who's worked in government in Alberta has worked for PCs doesn't mean we're PC supporters. It's the job of bureaucracy to keep the trains running (sometimes even on time!) in accordance with whatever the elected officials decide is the mandate. If that mandate is too egregious, then we lodge complaints, or whistleblow, or quit.

So, NDP, when you get back in, don't treat the civil service as remnants of the old guard.

I mean, fuck, I worked under the Klein government and I still wrote a report dismantling Klein's ""My cuts to seniors' benefits haven't hurt George and Martha at all"" rhetoric with data, which he promptly shredded, because truth and conservatism are like a sustainable economy and bitumen.

Anyway, Klein's shredding of the report was leaked right before the election, but good ol' Albertans just lapped that ""He listens; He cares"" bullshit right up.",g0kh91a,t3_i4lu9p,1596726274,1596751474.0,/r/alberta/comments/i4lu9p/why_is_everyone_so_surprised_the_ucp_is_fucking/g0kh91a/,2020-08-06 15:04:34,2020-08

Here is what to do - call and email the decision makers. Tell them the current measures are not enough - there are bound to be covid cases in the 4000 students and their families, there are bound to be some that ignore guidelines (look at the huge gatherings of young people in parks in any city), there are bound to be inadvertent exposures in dormitory bathrooms, lecture hall entryways, meal hall.

I hope you have no loved ones in old folk homes, the retirement homes, here in Canada you gotta get tested repeatedly to do visists, etc. 

Don't let your stress attack others, if you believe some are being stupid, or are simply misinformed, inform and move on.

But yes, this kind of plan will require more time and the hiring of teachers. School boards will need time to poll their students to determine who will be returning in person and who will be opting to stay home. Then they will have to poll teachers to determine who will be going in and who will have to opt for a home assignment due to health reasons (they will have to decide if they want to take the teacher's word for it or demand a medical note, but if they want a medical note then it'll require additional time to process). This will also be complicated by what the plan is for elementary schools as many teachers have children of their own. If their child's school decides to go into a hybrid model and the teacher has no other option for child care but to stay home, then that will become a problem.

Once they've determined all of that, then they will be better able to determine whether any hiring is necessary. For students opting to stay at home, some might need to be provided with technology and Internet access. This won't be as large of a move as before, but there's bound to be students who will either need a replacement or their situation at home has changed and will now require board technology.

Bottom-line:  if the plan is to reduce class sizes and/or allow the option of full time remote learning, then yes more teachers will need to be hired. They will need to determine the specific subjects that will be in demand before hiring. 

Anyway the longer Stephen Lecce drags his feet on this, the less time school boards will have to do all of those things on top of getting the school buildings ready for September. Because of Lecce's announcement, my board has postponed the surveys they were going to send out to staff and parents which is sensible since who knows what Lecce is going to say. So whatever the plan is, boards will have one month to get it ready for September.

Without additional funding however, boards will go for the cheapest option which is full time reopening in September with no reduction in class sizes and  ""additional, unspecified health and safety protocols"". I put those in quotation marks because that's a direct quote from my board's spokesperson and of the five reopening options, the one they currently favour.",fznp2dp,t3_i05q3j,1596054819,1596080019.0,/r/ontario/comments/i05q3j/education_minister_sflecce_to_release_plan_for/fznp2dp/,2020-07-29 20:33:39,2020-07

# Briefing Highlights

Today's live highlights of the press conference. This post will be updated as the press conference progresses.


## Fitzgerald

- Please be cautious with rumours on social media. These comments are not helpful and hamper our effectiveness. Please be kind and understand what other people are going through.
- FG went over the usual recommendation over social distancing.
- FG mentioned the public health team and the retirement of one of the members. FG started crying as she said her goodbye.
- Today is the last meeting with Ball.

## Ball

- It is not unexpected that we will see new cases.
- Over the past few days there have been messages on social media about US service members downtown. Haggie will talk about this more later. It is good that this was reported and is why we have the report system exists.
- Travel is being monitored, within the Atlantic Bubble as well as any other travel. The measures are only guided by public health.
- 12000 travel requests have been approved.
- The Labrador west border, the St. John's airport and the Marine Atlantic ferry are the only points of entry.
- There has not been a large increase in the number of people travelling.
- Finding accurate information is difficult, and there are many cases where people are finding information on the internet that is not factual. Please use official sources (Meta: I think this was about mental health, but this is good advice for everything. That includes this post, please read the disclaimer below)

## Haggie

- The four active cases are a younger demographic.
- The virus doesn't care about age, it's important that all age groups can get this virus.
- With the issue of the US service members, the result was that there was a miscommunication/misunderstanding of the members.
- The messaging from the CSBA wasn't clear enough, and we provided clearer messaging to the airports, bases and hotels so that they understand.
- Thank you to the staff responsible for resuming health services.
- We are 85% levels across the board.
- This isn't the case for primary care. (Wasn't clear how it was different, unclear language).
- A vaccine might be next year before we see it.
- We also have a medication that is approved for use in severe cases.
- This is the last briefing with Ball, Haggie then congratulated his government for the good job they did.

# Media questions


Short | Reporter Name | News Outlet
---------|----------|----------
PC | Peter Cowan | CBC
PJ | Peter Jackson | The Telegram
AK | Allison King | VOCM
JC | Jodi Cooke | CBC

## PC

- US Military flights have been coming and going through the whole pandemic, why are the instructions needing clarification now? The CSBA rules were unclear. This is federal jurisdiction, and we do not have access to or influence over what happens in airports. We have tried to clarify with the CSBA on several occasions. We have delt with the situation yesterday ourselves to ""my satisfaction"".
- Bar and restaurant owners are concerned about the events from the weekend? Those businesses can refuse service to anyone they see as being a high risk. It's everyone's job to assist here.
- Around masks, NS is making them mandatory, are we looking at making them mandatory? We are investigating that. There could be mask fatigue if we require them too early. When masks are most effective is when we want people wearing masks. The decision isn't final yet.

## PJ

- For the American service members, there is a conflict. You are asking not talk about rumours and yet saying it was good that the service members were reported in the way they were? Haggie: This is a moving target. Facebook and social media might be easy but it not a medium that should be used for reporting concerns. People should use the reporting form or contact public health. The problem is when someone shares a post on Facebook 700 times and it turns out to be, second or third hand information or a picture that is six weeks old.
- Women from Asia, so we know if there were any obvious symptoms, or something found later? FG: Can't speak to a particular case, but my understanding is that they were mild and only recognized in retrospect. 
- Any movement on establishing guidelines on choirs and wind instruments? We are reviewing, but we are not any further along. We are a small team.

## AK

- Do we know what the upcoming school year will look like? The school boards have been working. There are a number of plans put in place working with them. Safety for students was the priority and it was important to talk to all involve. There was a decision made by the department to get the teachers in early. We are looking at other provinces as well. There is no full plan yet.
- For the military personnel, was there any testing or contact tracing? We have no symptoms reported and you would need to ask the US military on what scanning was done. We have no been made aware of anyone who was sick on that flight.
- Why is it that a single worker only allowed to work in one home, but they can do out in public/bars. Has that been reviewed recently? That rule was added because of clusters in long-term care. We were the first in Canada. You are right in that, that policy conflicts with the other restrictions that have been lifted. We are looking into it.

# JC

- For mandatory mask wearing, this has becoming political in other regions. Are you satisfied with the number of people wearing them? FG recapped recommendations. If we were to move into a higher level of COVID-19 in the province, our advice will change.
- The case on Sunday, has all contact tracing been done? Yes, no further contacts.
- New release on strain on public service members and opening up pensions for those members? It's been considered. What we are seeing a number of requests from people receiving pensions. There have been a number of attempts over the years. We have started an engagement process to see what can be done to provide support.


## Abigail (Some Quebec news outlet, I think)

- A letter was sent to your office about providing fewer restrictions on a section of the Quebec/Labrador, any update? Ball: We allowed movement across that border for particular services that exist on one side of the border or the other. This does not extend to the rest of Quebec or NL. We have had requests to expand the freedoms. We are being cautious, but we can't allow these people to enter the rest of the province while not allowing others.
- Can you confirm that you have not received the letter? Ball: People can apply like everyone else to gain access more services as needed. FG: I have no seen any letter, but I will look into if it's been recieved.
- On the GovNL website, it now says, individuals that work within the Atlantic Bubble and Quebec/Labrador do not need to isolate. Are the people on the Quebec/Labrador bubble a threat? FG: The prevalence is low on the border but the Atlantic Bubble changes do not apply. Ball rehashed the situation. We understand the situation but we are in a pandemic.

Ball is giving some closing remarks that I won't recap. That's it for today, hopefully I will be free next time to do this again!

3769,IslandLax,britishcolumbia,"&gt; Money is one thing but enjoying your life is more important, maybe your happier in Quebec, it seems like a very extreme choice to save a few bucks.

There’s no housing crisis for people with money. If you have money, and can afford the luxury of living in a desirable real estate market, stay in BC and live your life. Like you said, living life is more important! You referred to over $350,000 as “a few bucks”, so maybe this is you.

But... if you find yourself referring to it as a housing crisis, are paying more than 25-30% of your take home pay on living expenses, can’t save for a down payment,  retirement,  kids college, you’re buying things on credit, still have student loan payments, are working more than one job... how is that enjoying life? This is what me and most of my university or college educated friends were doing. Most of us opted out for a better life. 


&gt; I know for sure I would rather live near my friends and family.

Oh ya, if I had the money I’d probably do it. But I’m a realist, and not an idealist. So I’m becoming financially secure and enjoying every moment of my life, stress free. I visit enough to not miss it.

So to your question of being jealous, not at all. You can have it. There’s no “fixing” anything, it’s the way it is. More people are buying there, and they have the money to do it.

Then how much will they have to pay trying to recruit from provinces that are short too or subsidize post-secondary education even more?

3791,Molianne,Quebec,"I was born and raised on l'île and still live there with my husband and my 2 year old. It is absolutely wonderful to live there imo. Just crossing the bridge back from work feels like going on a mini vacation.

We've been lucky with our neighbors, they are all very respectful of one another and easy to talk with if needed (or just for fun of course). Now you do need to speak French for the neighbors, but pretty much all small businesses will be able to help you in English. Then again, the majority of those businesses will be closed during winter mainly because of the lack of tourists.

The bridge is way past overdue its ""retirement"" time so it's constantly being worked on in the summer (mainly) during the night. A pain, but I for one am so used to it that I just take that time to enjoy the River and my music. We ""should"" have a new one in 2027. If it's not pushed back to a latter date for the Xth time. (For some reason, some will think I'm crazy, but I feel safer on this bridge than the Québec or the one beside it (can't remember the name, I rarely ever use them anyway.)

One of the major point you need to know is that l'île is considered ""patrimoine culturel"" so anything (ANY. THING.) you want to do on your house or around you have to get a permit for, but not only from the Village you live in: first the Village, then the MRC (regional County municipality) de l'île and then the Ministère de la Culture which is often where problems arise (we personally have been lucky with them so far).

You'd also have to consider the fact that yes, a lot of tourism happens in the summer so when strawberries or especially apples are in season, we have to wait longer before going home because of the cars and the fact that most will drive under the max speed. Then again, if you're not trying to reach home in the middle of the afternoon, the jammed traffic will be stuck trying to leave the island all at once when you're coming in so it's a lesser problem. We just plan accordingly when going out :)

Seriously? you want to go on about that? Someone said the obvious thing and you are presuming its a new directive? wow.... Besides which, one department does not equal the university as a whole.

Context is important. In a discussion of impacts of spending reductions, saying a certain number of people no longer work there is going to be interpreted by most people as meaning that they eliminated those jobs as a part of the response. The method used to find those reductions is not as important, and in common use someone losing their job involuntarily, or ""voluntarily"" by being told to take a package or be fired, is the same thing... those people are still out of work, they still didnt want to be.

3806,PerpetualAscension,ontario,"&gt; The first joke here is every union job I've ever worked has paid better and been safer than every non-union job.

Those benefits come at an expense, the joke here is you dont understand that. If unions create benefits, than companies would thrive to get more of them. 

&gt;The second joke is your comment about ""coercing"". These are long-term care homes aka an essential service. If you're going to need one you don't have the luxury of deciding you'll just hold off. They don't need to coerce because sooner or later you'll need to come to them.

Who gets to decide what is ""essential service""? Where do you even come up with that? Its not up to you to classify whether people's businesses and jobs are essential or not.

You produce no products or services. The greedy for profits retirement homes do more for their clients, than liberals who are full of hot air and not much else.

Provide better long term health facilities, why cant you do that? You still didnt outline why you cant do that? If ""for profit"" centers couldnt compete with centers that are not for profits and are obviously better, than how would ""for profit"" centers even exist?

Sit down rabbits.

*However, the substitution of bureaucratic compliance for profit-making decisions reduces profitability, usually with little or no benefit to anyone from the regulations being complied with. The end result is once again a reduction in the profitability of investment, and subsequently less investment takes place. Wages are stunted, thanks to self-defeating unionist propaganda.

3812,PerpetualAscension,ontario,"&gt;The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care investigates both Profit and Non-Profit facilities. There’s not a separate governing body for each, but nice try.

Can you show evidence of them demonstrating equal scrutiny against both? And no conflict of interest when eliminating actual for profits centers will yield more actual profits in the hands of those same central planners? Because there will more demand for their oversight as oppose to private for profit driven oversight that has to compete to keep operating? You dont see how creating more demand for central planners and unions is kind of maybe 'profit' motivated? Or its okay because they have such 'great intentions'?

&gt;And while we’re on the subject of not addressing issues being brought up, how is a deflection to systemic racism even remotely relevant to the topic at hand? Or any of the other fever dream points you brought up on your little tangent? 

Stop framing the discussion in dishonest way. Its not a deflection. Because you cant elaborate what it is Im suppose to be deflecting. Its point out how you point out problems and all youre solutions mean the same thing:

*“The vision of the anointed begins with entirely different premises. Here it is not the innate limitations of human beings, or the inherent limitations of resources, 
which create unhappiness but the fact that social institutions and social policies are not as wisely crafted as the anointed would have crafted them.”*

― Thomas Sowell, The Vision of the Anointed: Self-congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy 


*“One of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce, subsidized those who refuse to produce, and canonized those who complain.”*

― Thomas Sowell, The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy 


*“To believe in personal responsibility would be to destroy the whole special role of the anointed, whose vision casts them in the role of rescuers of people treated unfairly by “society”.”*

― Thomas Sowell, The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy

“*It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.*”
― Thomas Sowell 

&gt;Finally, your solution to a profit driven model, is to push for another profit driven model?

Again, stop framing discussions in dishonest way for some hollow victories.  You misunderstand. Everything is working properly. Bad businesses fail and be replaced by better working models. For profit retirement homes like everything else thats for profit and allowed to compete is not immune for mistakes and pay for them much sooner than public sector.

Can you outline by what magical concept you feel the public sector is better? Do they hire better people? Or pay them better? Why cant you explain to me the handicap that is stopping you from doing this voluntarily?  Dont people want to place their parents into the best place? Wont that drive prices down because other competing for profits facilities would have to compete? So they would have to improve or risk losing all that precious profit.

&gt;A left leaning one? When did caring for our elderly and infirm ever become an issue of politics? 

“*The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.
The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.*”
― Thomas Sowell, Is Reality Optional?: And Other Essays 

Please explain to me how you believe central planners can regulate aspects of economy better than free market?


*The fact that no given individual or set of individuals controls or coordinates all the innumerable economic activities in a market economy does not mean these things 
just happen randomly or chaotically. Each consumer, producer, retailer, landlord or worker makes individual transactions with other individuals on whatever terms they can 
mutually agree on. Prices convey these terms, not just to the particular individuals immediately involved but throughout the whole economic system- and indeed throughout the world. 
If someone else somewhere has a better product or service, that fact gets conveyed and acted upon through prices, without any elected official or planning commission having to issue 
orders to consumers or producers - indeed, faster than any planners could assemble the information on which to base their orders.*


*However overwhelming it might be for a government agency to try to keep track of 24 million prices, a country with more than a hundred million people can far more easily keep 
track of those prices individually, because no given individual or enterprise has to keep track of more than the relatively few prices that are relevant to their own decision-making. 
The over-all coordination of these innumerable isolated decisions takes places through the effect of supply and demand on prices and the effect of prices on the behaviour of consumers and 
producers. Money talks- and people listen. Their reactions are usually faster than central planners could get their reports together.*

*While telling people what to do might seem to be a more rational or orderly way of coordinating an economy, it has turned out repeatedly to be far less effective in practice.*

3818,QueueOfPancakes,ontario,"&gt;A pay cut and salary freeze aren’t really the same thing.

When inflation has taken place, yes, it is exactly the same thing.

What's your complaint about the pension fund? They invest their money into their retirement savings. Do you object when a company has an RRSP matching program?  Teachers contribute 10.4% - 12% of their annual salary into their pension fund and it is matched by their employer. Their pension fund should make everyone proud, it's recognized around the world as an example of how effective pensions can be when they are managed properly. We should be pointing to it and demanding the same for everyone. Why do we only contribute 5.25% (including both employer and employee amounts) to CPP, and only on earnings up to $55,200? Imagine if CPP guaranteed you a retirement income equal to your top earning working years income. Imagine how much less stress everyone would feel if no one had to worry about retirement.

&gt;For every great educator there’s a lazy person

Again, the facts simply don't support this. There is absolutely no way that 50% of teachers are ""lazy"". In fact, teaching is an incredibly demanding job, as many parents are unfortunately experiencing first hand this year due to covid as they try to homeschool their children. Now imagine having to teach a class of 30+ kids, several of which may have additional challenges.

The only thing such ""government pressure"" will cause is worse outcomes for our children, which means worse outcomes for us all. Again, it just doesn't make sense.

3832,stugots__,NovaScotia,"NB Resident here. NS is a beautiful province and IMO one of the nicest, prettiest places this country has to offer. On one hand you have the city of Halifax, a modern city with lots to offer and at the other end you have beautiful ocean side towns like Lunenburg or Digby that sits on the Bay of Fundy. Beautiful towns with great seafood and wonderful people. If I had to move from NB, my very first choice, hands down, would be anywhere in Nova Scotia. If you can land a job that either lets you commute in and out of Halifax, you'll live a good life. Even better, if you can find a job in a smaller town your life will be incredibly affordable and safe. I have a friend who lives in Toronto and has a summer home 90 mins or so outside Halifax, on the water. He's selling his home in Toronto and moving full time to NS. 

I've been to Toronto several times for work and there is no comparison to the Maritime life in general and Toronto. You will find that Maritimers for the most part work to live. I don't find that same philosophy in Toronto. Its a different pace of life here. You won't find the same amenities here or the same cultural influences that you will find in Toronto and as a result you may miss some of that but unless you live right in the heart of Halifax you wont be house poor neither. People still have the idea they can buy and pay for their house as part of their retirement.

&gt;The validity of this test was established for people with symptoms and is less reliable when testing people without symptoms. False positives become apparent when testing large numbers of people that do not have symptoms. It is worth mentioning that a negative result is extremely reliable, especially in asymptomatic. Testing asymptotic is warranted in certain situations, such as to address research questions and generate research hypotheses. 
&gt;
&gt;Every positive test result is evaluated in light of the laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological information. If the initial positive test result is in question, the original sample is re-tested along with two further samples. If most come back negative, a false positive is declared. This process can take from 1-10 days due to the various different labs potentially working on the test.
&gt;
&gt;The impact of a false positive can be substantial when associated with long-term care and retirement homes. Upon being notified of the positive result, the facility will enter into outbreak protocols. Staff, residents, and families are notified creating a source of anxiety for all concerned.

Mixing public and private is the worst of both worlds every time.

It's the loss of revenue that decreases the quality.

3857,Vensamos,alberta,"**Performance Benchmarking**

AIMCo does not report 10 year annualized figures instead opting for 5 year annualized, so I have had to calculate 10 year annualized figures by pulling the one year return figures for each year across several reports (which was a massive pain in my ass, thanks AIMCo), and using the following formula:

(1+Year1Return\*1+Year2Return\*….\*1+Year10Return)\^1/10 - 1

Formula source is in the links comment.

I break out my calculations below. The numbers are sources from the annual report and page number pairings in the below table.

AIMCo total

(1.079\*1.048\*1.102\*1.125\*1.099\*1.090\*1.058\*1.093\*1.023\*1.106)\^(1/10) - 1 = 8.2%  
 

AIMCo - Balanced

(1.099\*1.049\*1.119\*1.140\*1.112\*1.101\*1.062\*1.104\*1.250\*1.118)\^(1/10) - 1 = 11.4%

As a crosscheck, I compared the above calculations for a **five year** case, as the 2019 annual report does report a 5 year annualized return of 7.4% for the overall fund on page 27.

That calculation broken out is:

(1.090\*1.058\*1.093\*1.023\*1.106)\^(1/5) - 1 = 7.4%

That’s a match to the reported five year return, so we can be confident that the formula is solid. 

The other four funds all have weird little idiosyncrasies. Like the ATRF reports 1, 4, and 10 year annualized returns (**4**? Why??), but they all fortunately have 10 year annualized (hurray for me!). As such, the 10 year annualized return per the annual reports of each organization are contained in the table below, with the figures calculated for AIMCo above filled in. 

&amp;#x200B;

| **Fund** | **10 Year Annualized Return** | **Relevant Document** | **Page Number** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| AIMCo – Overall | 8.2% | AR 2012, 2015, 2019 |19, 24, 27|
| AIMCo – Balanced (Pensions) | 11.4% | AR 2012, 2015, 2019 |27, 3|
| Canada Pension Plan | 11.1% | AR 2019 |55|
| BC Investment Management Corporation \* Pension class only | 9.8% | AR 2019 |16|
| Alberta Teachers Retirement Fund | 9.2% | AR 2019 |43|
| Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan | 9.8% | AR 2019 |31|

**Comparisons**

Broadly we see that AIMCo’s pension management **significantly** outpaces its overall fund performance. Part of the reason for that become clear when you look at page 3 of the 2019 annual report. The pensions and Heritage Fund, among other similar assets are invested roughly equally across money market assets, equities, and illiquid assets, while the government funds are invested 77% in money market. This means things like bonds, short term debt, and loans. Whether this is reasonable government policy in managing its short term spending money I’m not sure, but it’s **very** important to remember that headline AIMCo return figures **do not** refer to the Pensions and Heritage Fund. **16%** of the fund has nothing to do with either Pensions or the Heritage Fund, and appears to be invested in much lower returning asset classes.  

Additionally, from the table above we can see that Pensions and the Heritage Fund, on a ten year basis performed very well compared to relevant other organizations. AIMCo’s performance has been basically neck and neck with the CPP (slightly ahead at the moment, but the delta is so small that one year could shift it the other way) and **significantly** ahead of BCIMC’s pension class, as well as the ATRF and OTPP.

**Commentary**

Taking the politics and messaging out of it, and just looking at hard numbers, it appears to me that when it comes to managing pension money, AIMCo is a solid investment manager when compared against its peers. As such, AIMCo likely has the chops to manage a prospective APP and achieve its return objectives, as well as being likely to manage the ATRF well. 

Whether that demonstrated competence is a **reason** to give them such portfolios, is of course a separate conversation.",fxktqvj,t3_hoymt4,1594420226,1594445426.0,/r/alberta/comments/hoymt4/aimco_a_detailed_breakdown/fxktqvj/,2020-07-10 22:30:26,2020-07

3880,RutabagasnTurnips,alberta,"So currently in Alberta and most provinces &gt;60%(more then &gt;75% in AB) physicians generate income through fee for service. This is negotiated as a collective. Once a fee is determined billing by code begins. Example I go see my Dr, they assess me, order and review some blood work and then bill the gov for that time and service. Last assessment pegged average AB GP total earning around 270k. It is important to note though that this is an amount before they have paid for overhead, property taxes (if they own their locations, lease if they don't) employee salaries, their benefits etc. Lets not forget they also have their licences, practice insurance, continuing education and medical journal membership costs. They also count as self employed so they need to save privately for retirement, medical/parental leave etc. 

The idea that independently negotiating contracts/payments will result in less admin costs is a lie. Now instead of a larger body that negotiates for all Dr (afford through their membership fees) Each Dr now needs to negotiate individually with the gov. or a business. Billings are a MASSIVE list of items. Likely taking hours per physician to review and then hours more to negotiate if they don't agree.  Currently it takes years for agreements to be reached it will likely take longer for the prov to so that multiple times over with different people/organizations/associations.  They will also have to draw up multiple different agreements contracts and keep them updated for each physician versus one that covers them all. If it's a business they are contracting same thing, rather then 1 it will be 5+ for the different provincial areas. Those business will then have the admin cost of contracts/employment agreements with the different physicians. It is unlikely Dr will be cool with a flat salary unless the type of patients/work they do is very limited. The reason pay model was designed as fee for service was because as a Dr you don;t know what you are going to see/treat on a given day. So if they have few patients but those patients are more complex/require longer clinic procedures you bill more. Simple and quick less. It also allows their wage to reflect days they work shorter/longer. Lots of people are already familiar with how companies abuse salary employees by making them work unpaid OT. The idea a business won't try to do this as well is silly. They will totally expect a Dr to see all their patients vs leaving at 4pm regardless of how long/complex they may be in order to provide ""better, quality and competitive service"". So I wouldn't be surprised to see Dr saying ""F\*\*\* it, I don't have to put up with this BS and wage abuse. I can just move"" 

As someone else mentioned it is also a race to the bottom. The quickest way for a clinic to save money is to have less support staff. Say 1 receptionist. This means though there isn't a nurse to do height/weight/vitals/disease education/simple procedures/etc that allow the physicians to focus on things that require their hire scope. Trying to save more money? Then they will have to start doing their own billings versus having a staff member that submits all the billings for the different Dr in the clinic. So they are spending more administrative time on that as well since they now need to complete with ever lowering private industry. I also wouldn't be surprised if business try to incorporate bonus models to push Dr's to see more pt's or punish them for not meeting quotas. For complex patients though this means that they won;t get the time and attention they need. They also likely won't have staff in house to do education and will more and more be expected to education themselves. Good example is obstetrics, they are one of the lowest paid specialties but have patients that require massive amounts of teaching. To save costs more and more patients are expected to use community resources but those are going fast (ex. in 2009 a publicly provided prenatal class could be 36hrs (the one I took) now your lucky to get 16 hrs assuming there are even enough spaces for you in the class. Trust me when I say the 6 to 24 hrs your in hospital post partum is not enough for me to teach you enough to meet your needs and there is no question more doom inspiring for me then the times I have heard ""What's a cervix?"" when someone is in active labour)

Something I don't see much is the acknowledgement that physicians through their association setup's are essentially small business owners employing local individuals at hire then min wage. Often they actually pay really well, provide paid vacation and good benefit options for their employees. You can work for a Dr and actually make a decent wage were if you worked another admin job in business you would probably need more then one (I certainly did when I worked admin jobs my summers in uni). 

As time goes on and physicians have a harder time making ends meet more of the good ones will start going to other provinces. That will leave AB with the ones that can't get work elsewhere due to restrictions or poor performance/practices. It will be even worse for rural communities. A lot are already having trouble maintaining services/recruiting physicians to replace those retiring before all this. A lot of rural Canada relies on international attraction, essentially brain draining other countries of their best. If those recruits have a choice between ?$ versus $$ by picking a different rural provincial area for their first contract they will be less likely to pick here. The few that due may very likely leave after. Graduates from our Universities will also look elsewhere for employment to areas that provide them more stable wages, trust and stability. Eventually instead of us getting the best because we are booming AB we overall get no one or less then stellar options.

All the talk seems backward-looking and fixated on assigning blame (it's all Trudeau, Notley, NDP's fault) and all the actions seem to be focused on rewarding friends/donors/specific industries and cutting down public sector workers and anyone who isn't on their team (progressives and even centrists).

As far as communities, most of Nova Scotia population is concentrated in the strip between New Brunswick and Halifax and around the coast.  East and west of Halifax, the central areas don't have much for population. There are a number of places that are full of cottagers, mostly along the Northumberland shore (Tidnish, Amherst Shore, Northport, Heather Beach, Pugwash, Fox Harbour, Tatamagouche)  They are typically three-season places, with most use happening in the summer.  You'll find similar cottage colonies around Molega/Ponhook lake and Falls Lake.  Lots of people retire to the Annapolis Valley, particularly Annapolis Royal.

Outside of that, there is a lot of communities suitable for vacation or retirement, but it absolutely depends on what your vision for vacation or retirement is.  I envision a care-free condo at Bishops Landing on the Halifax waterfront, someplace where I can pull the door closed behind me and disappear for a few months.  You might picture a cottage on a couple acres of fertile loam where you can grow vegetables.  To each their own.

If you give a little more detail, I can probably give you a shorter list, but for now just get Google Earth and look at all the towns along the coast that are within your desired distance from the airport or city.

There are alternatives; we can fight back and we can ride out the storm but personally, I know dont have time. Unless they get voted out at the next possible moment a lot of us dont have the time.

3956,rush89,ontario,"To be fair my aunt and uncle have so many years in that they need to hit retirement age to not get penalized.

I even forgot about my 2nd cousin who has a masters in education. She left teaching for waitressing and hasn't gone back.

My 3 friends who are still in it are amazing teachers and do so despite the money.

Have you never heard of teacher burnout? They say if you are really giving it your all you burn out 5 years into it. At that point you either leave the profession or you just become a less effective teacher (put in less hours, don't do as much, etc).

I just did a quick google search and it says every year in the US 8% of teachers leave the profession. I also saw that 44% of new teachers leave the professions within 5 years which doesn't surprise me given I just referenced the 5 year burn out. We can trade anecdotes all we want but there you go.

Edit: I don't know how I let this one slide earlier:

&gt; It is not just summers off. It is 2 weeks at Christmas, 1 week march break, and another 11 paid sick days per year. Those 11 days are no longer bankable like they used to be so it ends up most people end up taking a good chunk of them. Plus they get PA and PD to do various things like catch up on work, learn new things, etc. So that works out 13 weeks of potential time off per year.

Yeah. You know what teachers do on March Break? Many of them are marking and planning. Christmas? Same thing. Okay, maybe not every second of every day but it happens.

Sicks days? Do you know how hygienic kids are? Everyone gets the flu because their kids all meet up from 8 to 3 and give it to each other and bring it home. Guess who is with those kids all day?

Listen. There can be lots of time off if there is an experienced teacher who really has it down pat and is very efficient. But then they are told that even though they've taught grade 5 for 10 years they have to do grade 4 next year. Say goodbye to your summer.

The thing I kept hearing in teacher's college and being in schools as a teacher was that the new teachers would last 5 years until they burned out. They couldn't keep the hours up so they either left the profession or just put in less time and became a less effective teacher. A few minutes ago I just looked it up and I found that 8% of teachers leave the profession annually and 44% do so after their first 5 years teaching.

You can argue until you are blue about how many teachers don't work all these hours and have it great but we'd be on the same page to say fuck them. There are so many good teachers out there right now struggling to get full time gigs while making shit money and working crazy hours just to do what hey can for their classes.

We need to put MORE resources into education to help allow every teacher be more effective and the easy start to this is smaller class sizes. Make it so each teacher doesn't have to plan and grade for 30 different children and they can more effectively teach. A 22 student classroom means I'm jumping right back into teaching even though I'd be making less than I am now.",fvsdhsa,t3_he70a8,1592948991,1592974191.0,/r/ontario/comments/he70a8/so_if_most_of_ontario_is_entering_stage_2/fvsdhsa/,2020-06-23 21:49:51,2020-06

BUT while I was certain that it was just allergies and a sucky cold (I work retail, and we’ve been open since stage one.) I still isolated, and got tested. It wasn’t about me anymore. I contacted my boss and said, “hey, I’m sick, I’m confident it’s not covid but I think the responsible thing to do is to see a doctor and get tested before going back. I’ll let you know ASAP what’s going on.” I don’t want to get my coworkers sick, or my family, or even the customers! 

I’m feeling much better and it in fact wasn’t covid so I got to go back to work but I can’t fathom being okay with endangering others at this point. It was a pain being unable to get to work, and to have to go to the doctor, and to be unable to get any errands done. I’ve heard ventilators are a bigger pain and covid spreading around the retirement town I live in anymore than it already has could easily become devastating. Like woe is me, I had to stay in a house with heat and a roof over my head and food on the table for a few days. I’m grateful to be privileged enough to know I am safe. It’s going to be painful next month to lose the money from missing basically a weeks worth of shifts but I can eat a few packets of ramen and peanut butter sandwiches for a couple weeks if I have too. It’s not going to kill me. And that’s not even a haircut! That’s a job! 

Anyway, sorry that you had to be the one to get the verbal dumping. I have no doubt op is taking appropriate protocols. People are just being very me-centred, which I guess I can’t get mad about because who isn’t sometimes but also it’s just tiring. I work with a lot of seniors and cottagers. Both groups can be a real handful to work with. And I’m certainly not bashing cottagers, because I’ve had some really wonderful ones who respect the community and understand our health care and population. People who really and truly say, “hey I’m here for the weekend/next two weeks/few months, and I’m ready to be part of the community while I’m here”. 10/10 people. But you can tell when people don’t feel that way too, and it’s a shame. And well, seniors gonna senior. They were doing that before the virus and they will after.

They also recently changed the seniority porting rules (from other districts) and that disadvantages newer teachers.  It's a desirable end-of-career and retirement area so older teachers try to parachute in, apparently.  

Housing is less expensive mid island than Victoria but over-priced in my opinion.  Rental housing is in short supply.  There's no regional hospital - the closest are in Nanaimo or Comox.  However, the outdoor activities are great and the area is beautiful.  It is a majority of white folks and more retirement focused age-wise.  There are large income discrepancies between haves and have-nots among students' families.  Poverty, food security, inadequate housing, and addiction have featured in each class my family member has had over the years.  Some of the stories are heart-breaking.  

A friend teaches in Port Alberni -- it was easier to get a contract position there although she had to cobble contracts together to get enough work to make it pay enough as steady TOC gigs.  Comparing Alberni to Parksville / Qualicum -- in Alberni, the housing is cheaper, the summer air quality can be bad, the road in can be treacherous in the winter, and there are  more social issues there than she expected, coming from Vancouver.

They don't get higher paying jobs. Even with more and more Canadians now going to post-secondary school, incomes have held stagnant for decades upon decades upon decades. If jobs were higher paying, incomes could not be stagnant.

I expect the actual reasons are multi-faceted. Some enjoy education for the sake of education, others want to make their parents proud, and some simply don't learn how to do math before going to post-secondary school. Anyway, that's beyond the topic of conversation.

Minimum wage might not even cover the necessities, but even where it does, there is still the issue of not leaving much to save for retirement. Most people don't want to work forever.

3982,crazy88keith,alberta,"I think keeping similar conditions is part of opting out of the CPP.  What would be different would be the governance and investing side of running the pension fund.  

Even if AB could set its own retirement date it would be a huge pain to implement practically.  There would need to be some kind of transfer agreement with the rest of Canada because, Albertan or not, you'd still be Canadian and have the right to travel and work freely across Canada.  So all governments would rightly be concerned that every single Albertan would move out of the province the day before their 65th birthday.  Or people might use 2nd addresses etc. to be residents of neighboring provinces to choose the pension plan they prefer to be in.  Huge headache for governments, not likely to happen.

You will not be able to opt in or out personally.  The Province opts in or out.  Best you can do is vote to support the government who has the position you want, or move I guess (sadly).   

There's precedence for all of this.  Quebec has it's own pension plan the QPP that replaces but is in line with the CPP.  Check it out for a point of reference:

3985,Likesorangejuice,ontario,"Austerity doesn't even make sense with the slightest bit of thought put into it:

The government takes money out of the economy through taxation and puts money into the economy by spending. Spending tends to go toward supporting low income citizens, investing in infrastructure and trade, or providing other services essential to keep society functioning. If the government stops spending then it is expected that the money that stayed in the economy through lower taxes will fill the gap.

Meanwhile corporations exist to funnel as much money as possible to the top in the form of profits. Profits that are paid out to the wealthiest as dividends or capital gains can either be reinvested in companies or hidden in tax havens. 

Tax havens are also a way money can exit the economy, but with a much lower chance to re-enter as spending.

A lot of dividends that are reinvested in the economy are put into mature stock, meaning that instead of contributing to the initial purchasing of a start-up business they are just a placeholder in large companies hoping for capital gains. For the most part this money will keep circling around the stock market without producing anything except more dividends and capital gains. The majority of this money is not making it to lower income people except for some gains on their retirement portfolio *if* they have one.

Maybe this was more than a little bit of thought, but it stands to reason that reducing taxes and spending isn't going to have nearly the same effect of helping the lower class spend money on things they need and want, and instead supports the upper class putting more money in the stock market. The feedback of austerity would probably make the rich much richer while the poor would struggle.

3998,WeedleTheLiar,ontario,"Good.  It's time to shut down more of these authoritarian measures.

Not to rain on anyone's panic party, but active cases in Ontario are down over 25% (over 1000 cases) in the last week.  This is despite moving into stage 2, despite Trinity-Bellwoods, and despite BLM protests.  

We've been at around 4000 active cases since we flattened the curve in April.  Suddenly the numbers plummet due in zero part to any government action, or lack thereof.

If might be time to consider the possibility that nothing the government has done has been particularily effective, that this virus simply doesn't do well in the heat or outdoors and while we were inside and it was cold the virus spread no matter what.

This article contains various graphs of covid stats in Ontario:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Ontario

Note how the curve was already flattening when the state of emergency was declared, and already flat when the business shutdown started.  The only thing that may have had an effect was closing the schools and, even then, the number of active cases was already slowing.

90% of the covid deaths were people over the age of 60, as of late May.  **Less than 100 people, across all of Ontario, have died of covid-19 under the age of 60.**  Why are we still acting like this is an existential problem that justifies handing our autonomy over to the government?

60% of the deaths were in long term care homes or retirement facilities; facilities that the government was tasked with inspecting.  **Why are we still thinking that we can or should rely on the government to protect us when the only population that they were actually responsible for suffered staggering casualties?**

If you are at higher risk for complications, if you work with vulnerable populations, if you just don't want to take the risk of getting sick, I totally respect your decision to be careful.  Go ahead and take whatever precautions you deem necessary and good luck to you.  

But your fear does not trump the rights and freedoms of every other person.  I am not obliged to keep you safe (and neither is the government, actually).  

We will soon reach a point where the number of lives lost due to this pandemic will be comparable to those lost due to the precautions we're taking.  Think about people waiting for operations that aren't happening.  Think about people who will die due to the economic downturn and people who rely on programs that will need to be cut to pay for measures like CERB.  Heck, think about people who die of heat stroke when the cooling centers are closed.  

This is not a simple matter of ""we need to flatten the curve no matter what"".  It is a compromise between two bad scenarios: more coronavirus deaths vs the serious consequences of shutting down the systems we rely on.  

The governments and their ""experts"", at all levels, have decided that the pandemic is so bad that any measure is reasonable to save even a tiny number of lives.  We'll likely never know how many, if any, lives were saved (or lost) due to actions taken by the government but that won't stop them pushing for more power, more control.  Even now they're pushing for more restrictions, albeit petty ones, as cases decline.  

We need to accept responsibility for ourselves.  We need to stop trusting ""expert"" and look at the numbers because they're telling very different stories.  We need to ask ourselves if putting our lives in the hands of politicians was ever a good idea.",fv2y380,t3_ha9oqf,1592360394,1592385594.0,/r/ontario/comments/ha9oqf/ontario_wont_make_it_mandatory_for_people_to_wear/fv2y380/,2020-06-17 02:19:54,2020-06

This is just a chart of listings not average prices.

But prices probably are up a bit because the only people wanting to move in the middle of a pandemic *really* wanted to move for some reason, and were willing to pay a premium for whatever they could get. 

Where prices will drop (if they drop) is once C.E.R.B. runs out but there are no jobs, or worse jobs to go back to and people need to downsize, and fast.  There will be less income from international renters (notably students), and less students moving around at all since most colleges and universities are at least partially online until january (so many students will wait until january), which will make some properties unaffordable.  

You'll probably also see a reduced supply effect though, as all the 70 and 80 year olds who are still in homes delay going to long term care and their families trying to support that longer because retirement and nursing homes seem like a very dangerous place in the era of covid.

- Fitzgerald provided the usual recap of the recommendations.
- Fitzgerald: We might be able to move to alert level 2 in the third week of June.
- Fitzgerald: Clarification on isolation and quarantine. Those who are isolating from travel into the province must isolate, they are allowed to be outside on their property. They are not allowed to visit public spaces. Those who may have or have COVID-19 are not allowed to leave their home. See the website for more details.
- Fitzgerald: Try to spend some time outdoors with the nice weather, but keep contacts to those in your bubble.

- Ball gave the usual recap and thanks.
- Ball: We have been working with the business community in the province.
- Ball: We have a $25 million for the tourism industry along with other programs.
- Ball: The business response line has 1300 inquiries and 1200 of them have been resolved.
- Ball: Maximum of $10,000.00 for those who are doing rebates for renovations or new homes are there to stimulate industry.
- Ball: We have awarded $92 million of contracts this year for 80 projects. This is getting money into the economy.
- Ball: BC seen new cases because they moved too fast, and Ontario and Quebec have new cases.
- Ball gave a recap of the Canada stats for COVID-19.
- Ball: Look at South Korea and their spike after they relaxed restrictions.

- When are we going to hear more on the cost of the pandemic and the recovery plan, as asked in the letter reported about today? Ball: There is definitely a cost because of the pandemic. We are looking into this now. We will have a public statement of the finical statement before I step down.
- This is a federal decision, but what about the border between St. Pierre and NL? We have a friendly relationship with St. Pierre, and we are talking about things. We could see changes in the future.
- Teams can't play against other teams, can they play against themselves? We didn't make that decision it was based on the associations. Games are games, it's not so much the who, but the level of contact with competitions. As we move forward things will change, and this is being done partially at the national level.

Heather (CBC)

- Clarify about third week of June, that's next week? It's the third week of level 3, not third week of June. Week of June 21
- The business community is asking to end the public health emergency and restore the government to the province? Ball got really defensive to this question. We never stopped with the working of Government in the province. We are making decisions on public health and science.
- What are the plans for an economic recovery plan? The alert level system is part of that and the programs we are doing are part of it as well. We are also working closely with the Federal Government.

PJ
- In regard to virtual care, wondering if virtual care program is the first in the country. A task force last year recommended against it? Haggie: No, it's based on what people and there is science behind it. We have implemented a fully integrated system. This is similar to the existing walk-in clinics but virtual. It's about access and choice.
- Why the NLMA not part of the decision? Virtual care was provided for the NLMA members earlier, Nurse Practitioners are a different group and there was no need to talk to the NLMA for this kind of program. The NLMA do not have a monopoly on the health care of people of the province.
- For integration, electronic walk-in clinics, it's not shared the same with virtual, wouldn't this be a step backwards? Your question isn't accurate. Many doctors are not providing similar data, and they are already fragment and the virtual care is more standardized and provides better data sharing.

KR

- Spoken with a man living in a retirement home, he is upset that he can't resume his independence with things like shopping? We are having discussion on that now, and we needed to start slowly. We will have more on this soon.
- The Corner Brook testing site is gone? It's not needed because there hasn't been enough demand, but they can come back if needed. We have started some sentinel testing as well.
- Federal Government said they will be doing temperature checks, what is the province here doing, and why is this not being done at hospitals? The Federal Government is doing this, and we have seen it happening. It's one of the measures. (Ball didn't really add anything to the answer.) FG: There is a screening process for those who go to hospital, including staff. We have some stuff in place. The evidence for temperature screening isn't really there yet, so we are not doing it.

I like this comparison because Arizona’s cities have a very similar population density to Alberta’s, and their age demographics are quite similar too:

Phoenix: 1,238.30/km2, 3,207.18/sq mi

Calgary: 1,501.1/km2, 3,888/sq mi

Edmonton: 1,360.9/km2, 3,525/sq mi

Phoenix:

&gt;the city's **median age is 32.2 years**, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62.

Calgary:

&gt; According to the 2011 Statistics Canada Census, persons aged 14 years and under made up 17.9% of the population, and those aged 65 and older made up 9.95%. The **median age was 36.4 years.**

Edmonton:

&gt; In mid-2006, 11.9% of Edmonton's population were of retirement age (65 and over for males and females) compared with 13.7% in Canada.[28] The **median age was 35.3 years** of age, compared to 37.6 years of age for all of Canada.

4021,IrisesAndLilacs,ontario,"It’s hard because the family, if they had been more involved and able to see him start to refuse to eat, would feel more comforted by him passing knowing he had been offered food. The article does mention that not eating is common at the end with advanced dementia. From my understanding, you typically would not send someone to the hospital with advanced dementia who is refusing to eat. You’d keep them comfortable at the long-term home and they would die there. Most people in that stage would have directives that no heroic measures would be taken like CPR or tube feeding. If he has advanced dementia, he had a poor quality of life and it is common for patients and family not want them to suffer further from advanced treatment. 

I feel horrible that families are not getting the ability to go through the normal stages and be more prepared for someone’s passing. With COVID being so nasty with the elderly it is really important to keep them as segregated as possible. I know of a regionally run home that has over 200 beds. Typically, if they had a flu outbreak they would quarantine the home and do extra procedures etc. They would normally see a very small number of deaths due to the flu - maybe a couple give or take, and they would be people that you knew were doing very, very poorly - like you would have expected them to die within the year type thing. Now you look at the outbreak at the 236-bed Camilla Care Community. Eighty-three people, including 32 staff members, were sick with covid-19, and sixty residents have died. This is so much worse, and so unlike anything the homes have dealt with before. 

I can’t speak to the specifics of the case. There could be some real mismanagement happening. Having no air conditioning is not how I would want to treat our seniors. 

Not being able to properly communicate with family is hard. If the home had cases of COVID they may have been understaffed. They’re not supposed to be borrowing staff from other homes to limit transmission. I would hope that better than he’s fine would have been happening. It sucks. I’ve recently had an elderly family member that died that had dementia. They were so confused that they couldn’t really understand Skype the few times they tried with her children and it made her agitated. She was quite deaf so phone calls were out. We were lucky that they weren’t in a home that had covid and that the staff did a pretty good job of communication with family. 

I hope that overall procedures and conditions and minimum standards are reviewed for all retirement and LTC homes.

4025,magentashift,ontario,"This article makes a few reasonable points, but the title is complete garbage and a poor attempt to make an issue out of total nonsense.

We really don't need to dox the experts who are responsible for the nitty gritty details of turning out the research analyses, running, re-running, cross-checking statistics between groups of highly qualified epidemiologists with a variety of specialties. That's who those experts are, plain and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A ministry spokesperson told the CBC that the Command Table also draws on ""external experts who each serve voluntarily"" but declined to identify them.  

Good! We don't need to dox our scientists right now, no less ones serving voluntarily. Otherwise, I am quite positive that a number of the most highly qualified people being consulted with right now would have noped-out of that opportunity at this sensitive time. That's opens up a no-win situation and is begging for a host of unfounded criticisms from armchair-scientists directed personally back to professionals from people who are generally unqualified to put on shoes that do not use velcro.

I know one of these 'experts' who was contacted in retirement because of the expert reputation and specializations established throughout his career. He's well known in the circles of people who deal with these things, and that's the kind of 'external expert' that our ministry is recruiting.

To title this article as if there's a real problem with the fact that these experts are not being identified is seriously misguided. 

Not only is that title by Jonathon Gatehouse rather trashy, but the quoted contributions from Colin Furness at U of T are similarly embarrassing for himself:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I don't think \[Ford\] has an expert on speed dial,"" said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The decision making tells me it is not being driven by expertise.""  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Apart from some colleagues who participated in the early modelling of the disease, Furness said he doesn't know anyone who has been asked to advise the government. 

Perhaps Colin has not been sought after for consultancy because pubmed would suggest he's only ever published four scholarly articles, and apparently published nothing since 2016. 

I'm not sure how Colin was picked for this interview, but he certainly does not convey himself in a way that leads me to think he should be regarded as an authority on anything related to the matters discussed in the article. Despite Colin's credentials listed on his U of T profile he's creatively challenged the apparent value of his own qualifications by completely avoiding the opportunity to offer insightful comments in lieu of the opportunity he's seized to make speculative and empty remarks about Ford's speed dial list and hearsay from an unknown number of colleagues of unknown status/reputation. Having completely dodged the opportunity to provide any form of helpful and insightful comments in his interview with a CBC journalist, this really raises some pretty serious questions about Colin's actual competency and suitability to make any judgments about the matters discussed in the article.

But Colin can't help himself, and goes on:

&gt;And he says some aspects of the first phase of reopening — such as allowing household cleaners and staff to return to their jobs — made no sense at all.   
&gt;  
&gt;""I mean who is sitting around the table saying we've got to let butlers get back to work?"" Furness said 

Fucking rubbish hyperbole. No one mentioned butlers, Colin. Your attempt at trivializing a few particular details with these comments detract severely from any desire remaining to even try to take you seriously. Do you not realize that many people are living independently with physical/mobility disorders who *need* a household cleaner? 

Do you not realize that the the vast majority if not the entire framework of our public health policies has reliably been founded in public health education? Do you not realize that one such goal of this public health education would be to increase the number of people who are making independent and smart decisions for themselves to protect their own health and that of others around them? Did you ever think maybe that might result in an increase in healthy able people making their own decisions to avoid resuming services of household cleaners during the pandemic whilst allowing those others who require household cleaners to access those services? 

No... you didn't think, Colin. Your first quote in the article could have ended there ""I don't think."" U of T's PR team should gag your interactions with the public and media outlets if you're going to offer only empty and unsubstantiated opinions in the format of edgy and cynical remarks. You should be embarrassed to have wasted your opportunity to engage the public in thoughtful ways, and you are a very very poor ambassador of science for the taxpayers who are funding a lot of health research whether you are consuming those funds or not.

Besides my gripe with the title of this article and Colin Furness' pointless interview, yes the general public certainly deserves more transparency about how the information fed bottom-up from the experts to ministry representatives has been evaluated at a higher level and integrated into public health policy decisions.",ftiw94r,t3_gzki7g,1591741559,1591766759.0,/r/ontario/comments/gzki7g/ontarios_doug_ford_says_he_relies_on_covid19/ftiw94r/,2020-06-09 22:25:59,2020-06

This is a very good resource. There is a MAXIMUM amount of money a LTC can charge and most charge as close to it as possible. So the cost of staying is pretty similar. The amenities are the exact same in every facility. They HAVE to be. It’s required by law. LTC loves to market things like outdoor space and gardens because it sounds nice on paper, but most residents are not allowed out unless supervised. Staff don’t have time to supervise. It’s very much like jail and a rec staff will ‘take your mother for a walk,’ but your mother doesn’t get to decide when or for how long. LTC also loves to advertise private rooms. What’s the point of a private room? The majority of residents are on so many medications they don’t know what day it is let alone if they’ve paid more for a private room. Some do. Most don’t. Another thing we invest way too much money in that would better be allocated to paying staff more is food. Look at the menus. They are these grand menus that are impressive to read, but these people grew up on meat and potatoes. A good portion just want cereal. Half of them can’t chew that sirloin steak. Food is EXPENSIVE. 


Look at how much a basic accommodation is and how much the government subsidizes. They are the same. Take the subsidy and don’t enter LTC with more than $5 in your name. Live your life while you’re able to live it. Consider if you want to be kept alive at all costs. Dementia is scary and it doesn’t discriminate against age. Just because you’re a young 65 if you’re suffering from dementia you’re living an actual nightmare. Why pay 5k/month to live in a nightmare? Give it to your children. A charity. A specific staff member that treated you well. It’ll go further.

Your best bet is to enter LTC and pay out of pocket for a one on one aide or stay in the community. IMO community living has a pretty high QOL.

&gt; Physical distancing (previously referred to as social distancing) measures are approaches taken to minimize close contact with others in the community. The measures that are being used include the following: **Asking everyone to avoid crowded places and non-essential travel; Maintaining a two-metre separation from others when outside of the household;**

The reasons include:
- There is no resourses to make it self-sufficient, everything comes in by ferry or plane, when they can come in.
- There is a waste of resource allocation. The federal government saw this when they took away the majority of coast gaurd and sent it to Halifax. 
- Culturally, the Island is on it's death bed. I'm the first generation without the cod. I never grew up learning how to jig, fillet and flake them. Now mind you I am a towny but my family are from outports. Sure there are little pockets that will hold on to the culture, but that will be the minority and will eventually die off also. Even since I moved in 2015 I notice changes every when I come home. It breaks your friggin heart.
- the Province has crippled the Gen Y &amp; Z to pay for the boomers. And the ones who have realized this got out earlier while younger booms are moving back hone for their retirement. Why is the Avalon Pennisula paying for 17 ferrys most which don't get any real use?

We've had 928 confirmed deaths in the last month. Only 57 of them have been outside of outbreaks in long term care, retirement homes, and hospitals.

You take outbreaks out of this and we're down to 2 deaths per day on average.  

However, I do feel frustration with the province right now because there really is no clear plan, and those in charge don't seem to follow what little plans and recommendations that are in place already. Just make it mandatory to wear a mask when inside a building that is not your home, or at approved outdoor gatherings.

I agree,  We aren't doing Great.

&gt; we been failing to meet our testing goals often 

This was part a supply problem, and part a Freedom problem.  We did not have the capacity in MANY of the areas around testing, one frequent poster here works in labs and has laid out problems multiple times about getting supplies,  transportation of samples, to name 2 things the province couldn't actually consistently control.   Next we have a problem of people NOT going for testing,  We get the government telling us to go, then we go to the local testing station and get turned away.   There is a breakdown in executing orders, but the reality is it is only a day to 2 delay which isn't surprising but it very much shows up on our numbers.  We can't FORCE people to get tested. The government does not have that authority over our bodies

&gt; tracing has been a shit show 

Totally!  completely shit.  ZERO defense.  The entire system was set up poorly since SARS and never improved.  The fact if a case comes in Bracebridge but the person comes from Hamilton, the contact tracing has to be transferred from one hospital to another both understaffed duplicating work is ridiculous! 

&gt; no tracing app has been suggested to be use (other provinces and other countries are using them) 

Canada does have among the strongest privacy protections for its citizens,  launching an app for contact tracing is NOT an easy task here. But  I am open to someone showing me the loopholes in our privacy laws to grant the government the power.

Complete Failure for LTC,  We've been failing LTC homes for 20 years.  The expectation was that LTC's would transfer people to hospitals, once that didn't happen we took more than 8 days to respond and try a new plan.  That was a really long time.  And even the new plan didn't work because we did not have the staff to train,  Sadly the Army should have been called in much sooner just for the man power.  We did not have the beds or spaces PRE COVID for everyone in need of LTC, during COVID that was highlighted even more.

&gt; failed to get everyone to wear masks(/face coverings) from the beginning (2.5 months later they are suggesting everyone to wear it) 

This can be blamed on the Federal government as much as the provincial.  I also have not seen anywhere in law that the government can actually mandate face coverings in Ontario or Canada, I can only find that they can be recommended,  And Federally we told people they didn't work for far too long, now there is a mess of information out there making this complicated.  I don't blame the province for this,  I blame the business community for not mandating it for using their stores,  THEY have the power and the right to require it, and offer accommodations for those who can not wear one.

Just look at the math.
It costs $13,000+ per student a year.
So a class of 25 kids is like $300,000.
Which is especially crazy when you look at the education being recieved in the last 3 months.
I've checked on my kids classes and they are pretty sad. I don't doubt the intentions but it just highlights the value is not there for what is being paid. Compare it to the online experiences like outschool.com, or the tons of other options and it seems to highlight what is lacking in public education. If instead of the public costing 13,000 imagine what that could do for a child if you tied the funds to them and it could pay for their personalized knowledge and skill development.
A really good online class is $10 - $20 dollars. With $13000, that's 866 classes at $15.
Or let's say do 3 a day * 5 days a week * 42 weeks in the year. That's $9450.
Leaving you +$3000 for field trips, tools, experiments....
And that's all overkill. 3 classes a day that are pretty in depth is probably too much, but it highlights it's hard to spend that much money.
Or picture this: say a family has 5 kids that go through school. 5 kids*13,000* 12 years = $780,000.

What if you could just take that lump sum and put in the sp500 and take out %4 a year. You could have a tutor paid $31,000
And get way more one on one education than would ever be possible and It's just interest you would still have 700,000 at the end of 12 years... It could pay for college and then retirement.

I think the public is very happy with their monopoly on babysitting kids and the quarantine has highlighted it very much.

4057,GrabbinPills,ontario,"Home care is when nurses or other healthcare workers visit patients who are recovering at home, or do home visits for elderly or disabled people so they can keep living at home instead of going into Long-Term Care or a retirement home.

Twenty five years ago, the vast majority of this home care was delivered by public agencies. Since the Harris' home care reforms in the 90s (and Liberal tacit endorsement through the 2010s), now the majority of home care is delivered by private for-profit agencies, and the public agencies are increasingly starved of funding.

If you don't qualify for any or enough government provided home care, you can pay out of pocket for increasing amounts and types of home care provided by a private agency. Fewer and fewer people qualify for public care as the government shifts the eligibility standards.

This is how privatization and for-profitization of a once publicly provided health care service occurs. Now of instead of home care being given by a public full time home care nurse, it is more likely to be provided by a part time nurse or PSW that works at two different home care agencies and one long term care home to make ends meet. It doesn't take covid to make that a problem.

This bill is part of the government's restructuring of how home healthcare is delivered in Ontario, since the People's Healthcare Act of 2019 demolished how the government delivered public home care through local agencies (the LHINs).

edit: the following is a little less ELI5, but Ontario Health Coalition and other public health care advocates are warning that the lack of transparency and oversight provided in the legislation will lead to further privatization of the industry and create a growing home care crisis very similar to the LTC crisis we were facing before covid even hit (LTC waiting list was 30k and several years long before covid, hallway healthcare is a side effect of the ALC patients created by this wait list) where home care is increasingly high in demand, low in supply and delivered primarily by poorly paid workers employed by profiteering corporations that lobby the government for favorable legislative changes... the parallels to the current LTC crisis cannot be overstated.",fsjx92g,t3_guljr2,1591037482,1591062682.0,/r/ontario/comments/guljr2/ford_government_moving_ahead_with_home_care/fsjx92g/,2020-06-01 18:51:22,2020-06

Kamloops is great if you like to hike, kayak, and travel because it’s pretty central to everything and we have a tonne of lakes around us that are generally less busy than Kalamalka, Skaha, or Okanagan Lake. Events and places to meet people (concerts, art events, bars, or other common places) don’t really exist in my experience. That being said I do enjoy having grown up there and love how there are many opportunities to head into the bush to explore the land with my dogs. Peachland and Summerland seems to have a really chill vibe and amazing weather. Much warmer winters than Kamloops. Penticton (in my experience) is more of a “retirement” community and there are a tonne of tourists that visit in the summer. Penticton gets more concerts and has a huge art scene in the summer. Absolutely lovely weather winter and summer, however, in winter the highway connector to the rest of BC is questionable. I’d probably not recommend Salmon Arm... it’s a wonderful town to visit but it’s very much a small town. If you want the small town vibes though (keep in mind small town gossip) then Salmon Arm is lovely, has a sense of community pride, is again central to some great places to travel to /visit, and is generally really quiet.

4062,0-2drop,ontario,"&gt; it's naive to suppose that capitalists don't also collaborate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You can equally well say that by (definitionally) owning the majority of constant capital in the world, the capitalist class is holding hostage the ability of working people to work. 

This seems to be the crux of your issue. You seem to think about this ""capitalist class"" as some sort of unified conglomerate holding the poor down. Except, all you have done is created this group in your head and attached conspiracy theories to justify them as evil.

Rich people are not some sort of unified class. They are as diversified as any other class of people. They do not act to benefit their own class, they act to benefit themselves and the people close to them...like everyone else does. There is no cabal of illuminati plotting ways to keep the poor man down.

&gt; Because of the tendency of capital to accumulate, over time we can expect more and more of the capitalist class to diversify. A small business owner is much less stable than a typical shareholder of Goldman-Sachs. 

This is a pretty common myth, but there is no tendency of capital to accumulate over time. [70% of families with generational wealth lose it in the second generation.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/generational-wealth%3A-why-do-70-of-families-lose-their-wealth-in-the-2nd-generation-2018-10) 55.8% of the world's billionaires are entirely self made, while an additional 30.9% made at least some of their wealth themselves. Only 13.3% of billionaires inherited their wealth entirely. That mythical capitalist class of yours keeps cycling in and out members, because that's how capitalism works in reality.

Also, do you know who the typical shareholders of Goldman-Sachs are? Pension funds, anyone with a retirement savings account, anyone who owns mutual funds, etc. While those types of institutions might accumulate wealth over time, the ownership of those institutions diversifies over time. The 10 largest investors in Goldman-Sachs are investment firms, who hold those stocks on behalf of the diversified group of individuals and groups invested in their funds. Even at the highest level of that, no single fund owns even 7% of the company.  Then, of course, that 7% is effectively owned on behalf of thousands of individual investors who buy mutual funds or other investment vehicles from the fund. Once you get down to the actual level of individuals owning shares in a company like Goldman Sachs, a pretty good percentage of America owns stock in the company, in some capacity.

&gt; nationalize key industries, and support international socialist revolutions. 

I took philosophy and poli-sci in undergrad at a left wing University, too. The problem is that there seems to be far too much focus on theory and far too little focus on history. It's not like socialism or communism are new concepts that we just haven't tried out yet. It just doesn't work in reality. It has failed over and over again, and most of the countries that tried it have switched back over to good old capitalism. The only thing that really seems to divide the success and failure of socialist nations is how successful they are at transitioning back to capitalism when they realize socialism doesn't work.

Before you go trumpeting support for the great socialist revolution, maybe study some history texts about the places where it has been implemented in the past. Or, go talk to some people who have lived in both systems and ask them which one they liked best. To use the immortal words of Epic Rap Battles of History, ""But look at Venezuela, what you're fighting for sucks.""",fshjlif,t3_gt57ka,1590979109,1591004309.0,/r/ontario/comments/gt57ka/the_rush_to_get_back_to_work_is_not_coming_from/fshjlif/,2020-06-01 02:38:29,2020-06

4082,CJstuck,newfoundland,"Buy a house when you need a home to live in and you can afford to do so. Rent if you run the numbers and find you can be happy in a rental while pocketing cash for investments/savings instead of taking on a mortgage.

Don't consider it an investment and don't try to time the market. Same as buying stocks. If you are in as stable a situation as you can predict, buy the home, get it paid off as soon as is reasonable, and forget about whether it's going to be worth more or less a year, or 5 years or 10 years from now because - honestly, nobody can predict that, and you're buying a place to live in, not a retirement plan.

It's always a good time to buy in the eyes of your agent - because buying generates a commission.

Good luck. Many people in your shoes back when times were booming bought under the premise you had to ""buy now or be priced out of the market"". They are way underwater now, or if they over-extended or had a life event (divorce, job loss) lost a bunch of money. Everyone told them at the time it was the right thing to do.

4083,thegreatcanadianeh,alberta,"Regularly, I hear how Albertan visitors don't respect the locals to begin with. This is just them hitting the point of fed up, as far as a lot of them are concerned they are following the local rules and Albertans are flaunting that. That being said I do not condone them leaving bullshit notes/destroying/damaging their property. 

Smaller places don't want their small urgent care centers to be overwhelmed due to people thinking its their right to travel just because they have money and their province is out of their state of emergency. 

Alberta has a vastly different population curve. Mostly young, for example Cranbook is a retirement city. It would be considered high risk. If there's an outbreak in Fernie they get transported over to Cranbook or the pass, depending. Easy to overwhelm that city center and unlike larger places like Calgary or Edmonton where there are high populations, small care centers often are already short on supplies and STARS can only move so many to those city centers for care. Someone travels in and causes an outbreak and they'll kill a lot of people out there. Small places with extremely limited resources are pretty scared, and I don't blame them. 

As for notes telling you go back to Alberta eh, up to you if you listen.

4087,strawberries6,ontario,"&gt;**Ontario’s Progressive Conservative  government has issued a series of special orders to approve a handful of  plans from prominent Toronto-area developers and quash any potential  opposition, saying the projects are needed to help the economy recover  from the COVID-19 pandemic.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Known as  minister’s zoning orders (MZO), they allow Municipal Affairs and  Housing Minister Steve Clark to make a final ruling on how a piece of  land is used in the province with no appeals, such as those from  citizens or environmental groups before Ontario’s Local Planning Appeal  Tribunal.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**In just over a year, Mr.  Clark has issued eight new zoning orders, more than his Liberal  predecessors did over their entire last decade in office. He issued four orders in one day alone last month, including one to okay the  destruction of three small protected wetlands to make way for a large  warehouse and distribution centre in Vaughan and another to allow a  retirement community to be built on farmland in Markham and  Whitchurch-Stouffville.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Ford  government started issuing MZOs last year, after it scrapped a  contentious bill that would have allowed municipalities to request the  right to pass “open for business” bylaws exempting local projects from  various provincial rules, including environmental laws and those  protecting the development-free Greenbelt area.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some  critics charge the moves are rewards for well-connected lobbyists and  Premier Doug Ford’s PC Party donors. **The directives, they say, unfairly  circumvent the normal planning process and override the province’s own  policies – and are being misused while public attention is focused on  the novel coronavirus.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“It looks as though the provincial government under Doug Ford has found  them to be somewhat of a magic wand that they can wave when their  friends come calling for a special favour,” said Taras Natyshak, the  Opposition NDP’s ethics and accountability critic.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Julie  O’Driscoll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clark, called any suggestion that  political connections play a role “categorically false.” She said the  orders are a way to cut red tape for key projects that will create jobs  and housing. Each of these eight MZOs, she said, has been supported by  votes from local municipal councils.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**“These Minister’s Zoning Orders will help speed up the planning process  so that municipalities can be ready, once the COVID-19 emergency  declaration ends, to move forward on these projects,” Ms. O’Driscoll  said.**   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Some  critics say they fear the government’s use of MZOs could poke holes in  the protected farmland and countryside of the Greenbelt – which  stretches across Southern Ontario and encircles the Greater Toronto Area  – even though the Ford government has pledged not to touch it. (When  video surfaced in the 2018 election campaign of Mr. Ford musing about  handing Greenbelt land to developers, he recanted after a backlash and  vowed to leave it intact.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Tim Gray, the executive director of  Environmental Defence, now expects local councils and developers to  angle for ministerial zoning orders to free up long-requested carveouts  for Greenbelt lands.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Essentially,  the more of this that happens, you have got the province taking over  municipal planning,"" Mr. Gray said. “So it just becomes basically a  conversation between lobbyists and Queen’s Park.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier  this month, Richmond Hill council, north of Toronto, passed a motion  asking for an MZO to rezone Greenbelt land near the Gormley GO commuter  rail station to allow for industrial uses.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Ms. O’Driscoll, Mr. Clark’s spokeswoman, said the Greenbelt remains off limits.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We  have been clear as a government that we will not touch the Greenbelt,  so any MZO request for development that falls within the Greenbelt will  not be considered or approved,” she said in an e-mail.",fs0qjkp,t3_grsdom,1590614067,1590639267.0,/r/ontario/comments/grsdom/ontario_issues_special_orders_to_approve/fs0qjkp/,2020-05-27 21:14:27,2020-05

Those are the owners’ kids.

Owners are going to be close to retirement, if not retired, and spent their summers here to get away from the city they live in the rest of the year.

They need to submit a plan including isolation before being allowed in.

Their kids and kids’ families (who are in the picture) will mostly likely be denied access because they aren’t property owners. Then the question becomes how many people will come if their family can’t visit for the normal few weeks they do?

It’s the arbitrary decision. To allow these few thousand people who being typical around or past retirement age are the most likely to need hospital care and ventilators if they do get sick with COVID.

They were found to be failing to comply with public health orders including not having any isolation plans for sick residents.

They told Public Health that they have fixed the problems. I'm not sure the extent of what evidence if any was required of changes to be made. But the Hamilton Medical Officer of Health said the home was now in compliance.

Not once did I even mention wholly-owned Canadian companies. The role of the government is to provide stability, and that can be done with regulation and restricting (with objective limits) the way resources and systems are exploited and abused. Supporting a diverse system can provide stability when one sector is suffering. Encouraging investment from stable foreign regions could be good too. You wouldn't want a dictator or a war to instantly eliminate your foreign investments and tax revenue.

I don't really support any extreme solution to these problems, because that would radically change the economic landscape, increasing volatility, increasing risk, and reducing investment in a risky environment. But some long term guidelines with regulation, enforcement, and government support would be great. The whole situation is unfortunate, but happened gradually over the last decades as different industries were off-shored and investment was centralized on only one local industry.

There was some prosperity over the last decades, but a very large amount of wealth was exported and I don't see much diversification from Farming and Oil here in Alberta. So when those two industries are impacted, the entire province suffers massively. Environmental disasters and economic recessions have devastated all 2 of our industries, year after year after year.

There are a lot of technical experts in this province, in the industries that are hurting right now. Those exact same skills can be applied to many other industries in this province. But our current government seems to be stuck in an energy tarpit with absolutely no concept of risk mitigation through diversification. Pump that oil out of the ground. And do something else too because Oil is important, but it is having less value every year as technology becomes more efficient and simply requires less energy/oil.

Our governments should be aware of global trends and implementing solutions that even their opponents would agree with. Not dividing the public with political extremism by labelling things ""open for business"" and ""socialism"". Objectivity is the best approach, not political campaigning with lies.

4142,BoomToeShot,alberta,"The foreign home buyers actually have little to do with skyrocketing home prices.  The prices of homes in big cities are going up like mad in every single big city around the world, even big cities that are ""undesirable"".  They play a role, but their role is insignificant compared to AirBnB.

The silicon valley company has almost single-handedly destroyed the home ownership market in the downtowns and downtown adjacent areas in big cities everywhere.  AirBnB is taking neighborhoods and forcing the homeowners and renters to compete against properties that would normally bring in $2000 a month rented to a tenent into a $5000 a month AirBnB and it is having dramatic effect, especially when AirBnBs start to take up 5-15% of the neighborhood  This drives homeowners in neighborhoods out: ""why would I live in a chique neighborhood like Kensington or Inglewood when I could live somewhere else and turn that sweet property into an early retirement?""  The effect on renters is obvious now, reduced rental property availablility drives up the cost of renting, many low earning renters are completely priced out.

It's so bad in San Francisco, school districts have to bus teachers in from smaller cities 2 hours away, teachers can't afford to rent where they teach.  There are AirBnBs in SFO that sit completely empty for 2-3 weeks each month because the pressure that high priced AirBnB puts on the AirBnB market in SFO still garners more profits by keeping prices high in other AirBnBs than it would if it were rented out to a tenent.

AirBnB homeowners worldwide are broken down into three categories, 33% own less than 10 homes, 33% own 10-25 home and 33% own more than 25 homes.  66% of AirBnB operators own more than 10 homes, see the problem yet?  It's medium and large investment companies turning neighborhoods into profit centres and tourist destinations.  This is gentrification on steroids, it's not people moving in, it's investment corporations.

Hotels are getting fucked because AirBnB is offering better places at a cheaper prices, so hotel chains have gotten into the AirBnB craze, would-be homeowners are getting fucked because AirBnB investment companies are buying up huge amounts of homes and turning them into AirBnBs which superheats the cost of homeownership, actual homeowners are driven out because they are now incentivized to sell their home for the inflated price or succumb to the beast and turn it into an AirBnB, and renters, like the SFO teachers are getting wiped out completely.

So this is great for investment corporations and shareholders, it's great for restaurants and small business in the AirBnB flattened neighborhood, but it is extremely deliterious for first time home buyers, home ownership in those neighborhoods in general and for renters.  Restaurants in AirBnB flooded neighborhoods have been able to raise the prices of their food, locals are even getting priced out of eating at local restaurants.

If you think Uber and Lyft blindsided cities and taxi operators, AirBnB was even more insidious because it came with a friendly face.",fr9tcp0,t3_gn9l30,1590003343,1590028543.0,/r/alberta/comments/gn9l30/saudi_arabia_is_buying_shares_of_albertas_oil/fr9tcp0/,2020-05-20 19:35:43,2020-05

The retirement industry is at least as much of a shit show as LTC (I'd actually argue more of one usually), but this is somewhat separate from the issues in LTC as the systems currently exist.

Now certainly even in a fully private environment, these people and their families are paying a lot of money - considerably more than for an LTC placement if Hamilton rates are anything like the rest of the province for retirement homes.

&gt;Mike Harris, who was Ontario's premier from 1995-2002, responded to growing waiting lists in 1998 by announcing that more than $1 billion would be spent to create 20,000 new spaces. When the contracts were awarded for construction of beds, 68 per cent of them were handed to the private sector. Three giant companies, Extendicare, Leisureworld and Central Park Lodges, received 40 per cent of the contracted spaces. The public was to pay for building facilities to be owned and operated by corporations to enrich their shareholders.

&gt;Provincial election finance records showed that between 1995 and 1999 for-profit long-term care companies donated almost $340,000 to the Ontario Conservative party. That did not include thousands of dollars donated to the provincial leadership campaigns of Ernie Eves, Tony Clement and Jim Flaherty.

&gt;One of the biggest players in the private sector long-term care field is Chartwell Retirement Residences. Mike Harris now sits comfortably as the chair of Chartwell's board of directors and according to Unifor, another union in the sector, Harris pulls down $237,000 a year for this part-time job. Meanwhile, Unifor, says the company pays only the minimum wage to many of its front-line employees.

**March break** happened just before the outbreak, meaning that students and families traveled the world and brought back the virus.

**Immigrants :** A large number of migrants in Montreal have for origins countries that suffered large Covid-19 outbreaks. France, Italy come to mind. The ethnic make up in Toronto and Vancouver are very different than in Montreal, those cities having larger Asians and Indian/Punjabi immigrants. This also explains why Vancouver was hit first (Chinese) and reacted first.

**Snowbirds** from Quebec have a habit of spending the summer in Florida, most in parts what were hit hard by the virus.

**Geography:** Montreal is at the crossroads of travelers from Ontario to the U.S. and the other way around. Anyone infected who stop in Montreal for gasoline or lunch can likely spread the virus. Toronto is on the edge of a lake while Vancouver is on the Pacific and is surrounded on two sides by mountains, cutting at leas three ways the virus could have gotten there.

**Returning snowbirds** going to visit their parents in retirement facilities might have helped spread the disease within those facilities.

**The government in all of this**

**Neo-Liberal austerity** contributing in reducing **funding** for long term care facilities and the privatization of a large number of those.

**Privatization** of long term facilities where private firms hire **recruitment agencies** instead of full time staff. The temporary workers will work in different facilities over the same week, meaning that infected workers would carry the virus from one facility to the next.

**Migrant workers** also found work while their immigration status is being decided in those recruitment agencies and, because of language barriers or cultural norms, might not have been trained properly to fight the spread of the disease.

**Slow reaction** by the provincial government seeking to reassure the people and avoid panic could have lulled the people into a false sense of security, making them less careful.

They were found to be failing to comply with public health orders including not having any isolation plans for sick residents.

The local medical officer of health said they fixed the problems.

A month later, they have an outbreak (May 10). May 12th, they were again inspected, and cited for the exact same failures, plus more.

Days later, the facility is now empty, at least 80% of the residents infected, most of them now admitted in hospital, and over a dozen staff infected.

&gt; According to the order document issued to the Rosslyn, an April 15 on-site audit found the facility “inadequately prepared to respond to a case or outbreak of COVID-19, including; lack of sufficiently detailed outbreak response plan; lack of written policy and processes for in-home isolation of ill residents, and/or physical distancing.” 

&gt; At the Friday media briefing, Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, Hamilton’s medical officer of health, said the Rosslyn has complied with all orders relating to the April inspection, but a new order was issued Thursday, May 14.

&gt; According to the new order, an on-site audit conducted Tuesday found six non-compliance issues.

&gt; The issues included: lack of a facility staffing contingency plan; lack of a sufficiently detailed outbreak response plan, including active and passive surveillance of residents; lack of a written policy and processes for isolation of sick residents; lack of a facility plan to implement physical distancing; lack of adherence to proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use; and lack of staff training and education on appropriate PPE use, including how to don and doff PPE.",fqv4mbq,t3_gl3wjr,1589669772,1589694972.0,/r/ontario/comments/gl3wjr/rosslyn_retirement_residence_completely_emptied/fqv4mbq/,2020-05-16 22:56:12,2020-05

4169,adoptinglilkits,ontario,"&gt;All long-term-care homes in Ontario receive provincial funding according to the same formula and these funds are doled out in four “envelopes”: nursing and personal care; programs and support services; food; and a fourth broad category called “other accommodation” that covers things like administration, housekeeping, renovations and building maintenance.

&gt;Unused money in the first three envelopes cannot be used for profit and must be returned to the province. Operators can keep surplus funding from the “other accommodation” envelope, as well as revenue generated from the semi-private and private room premiums.

Sounds reasonable to me. The government funding intended to go towards resident care and services cannot be used as profit. Seems like if the for profit home digs up legendary efficiencies that allow it to save enough that it doesn't need to touch a portion of the government funding given for resident care...they can't pocket it as profit.

Public homes are using fundraising etc to come up with additional funding for the homes.

* Being an extreme burden on the pension system that almost every economist has been saying for years how it'll deplete it for Gen Xers and Millennials since the gig economy basically ensures neither of those generations (or the ones after them) will have a retirement.
* Calling GenX and Millennials lazy, entitled, and so on when both have had to start up and try to find work in two recessions -- one of which is currently on a path to see if speculation can maintain the economy before it tanks into a straight up depression.
* Not willing to train GenX or Millennials in the trades (literally every guy I knew in high school couldn't get into an apprenticeship because Boomers didn't want to have to pay them to work), or create jobs locally for them to take up.
* Having the audacity to complain about any of this while most of them (statistically) own a home, are currently vacation touring, or other such things and calling GenX and Millennials lazy for not already having everything they have -- as if working for the same wage they did back then can pay for anything now.

The list honestly goes on. Everything from having much higher divorce rates (we all know what that does to their kids' rate of success at this point), to the countless stories of parents who put themselves before their GenX kids, and so on...

4178,PM_ME__RECIPES,ontario,"10 major points I think need to be addressed in LTC to help form a basis of a better support system (and this is incomplete):

End for-profit operation of LTC homes. The data we have, both recent and prior to COVID-19, strongly suggests that care in for-profit homes is statistically inferior to non-profit and government-owned homes. For-profit homes take the same per-resident funding, and charge the same co-pays, as non-profit and publicly-operated homes - there are ZERO cost savings to the taxpayer by operating for-profit homes. And there is strong evidence to suggest that there is a detriment to a resident's well-being if they are placed in a for-profit home.

Change the funding model. Currently the only funding envelope where homes (and their parent organizations) can make a profit (in this case ""profit"" includes setting aside money for capital expenses, redevelopment, and contingencies) is the same one that provides money for staffing, regular maintenance, most equipment purchases, small-wares &amp; cutlery, right down to things like napkins and laundry detergent. Provide dedicated, planned funding for capital upgrades and redevelopment so homes don't need to make the decision between replacing broken Hoyer lifts today and fixing a leaky roof tomorrow.

Related to number 2, codify into the LTC Homes Act a guaranteed minimum of an inflation-matching funding increase annually. Perhaps even get as specific as envelope-related increases. As an example, wholesale produce pricing in the fiscal year ending March 31 2019 increased approximately 16.5%. In 2019 the Raw Food envelope funding increased by 0%.

Redevelop all old-build homes (and/or all C &amp; D class beds) within 5 years (doubles as an infrastructure project to help give the economy a shot in the arm). These homes were built with a much lower m2 per resident planned than newer-builds. Often you'll see 4 people in a room, narrow hallways, and smaller shared spaces. Several of these homes are already years behind on being redeveloped, and were not supposed to be operating in 2020. Besides the infrastructure deficits, these older buildings tend to be more expensive to maintain than newer buildings (on a per-resident basis).

Mandate a (preferably national standard) minimum level of staffing hours per resident for all positions involved in day-to-day care of the residents and the home. We already have a minimum standard for Food Service Workers, Cooks, Dietitians, and Nutrition Managers. Why not PSWs, RPNs, Housekeepers, and Maintenance staff? Rather than just feeling like a home is understaffed because you don't like how certain things are (or aren't) done, let's have a literal point where we can say ""yes this home is supposed to have at least X number of hours of PSW staffing, and they have X-40. They are understaffed. This also helps in the assessment of staff as we know there is a level which should be able to adequately complete all the tasks at hand. If a home employs at or above that standard, and is under-performing then we can start from the assumption that number of staff hours is not the problem - but rather equipment/infrastructure, management, training, or certain staff members themselves.

Get rid of the middle-men. Make all LTC employees provincial employees. Why send money to Chartwell for them to send that money on to one of their homes for that home to send that money to my colleague, and have to audit every step of the way? Have us employed by the province, and paid by the province. Hell, operate all LTC homes entirely through the MoHLTC and/or municipalities and regions. Have the operations money flow directly from funding source to facility. Not funding source to company to facility. Pay the staff directly from the MoHLTC/Municipality/Region. Unionize all non-management staff, ensure all LTC staff have pensions and benefits, and ensure consistent (possibly adjusted for Cost of Living in certain areas) levels of pay. This could also improve the ability to surge staff to homes in need (since they will already be employees), as well as improve the ability of staff to move from a job at one home to a job at another (without starting from zero each time at every home).

Professionalize LTC. We're already part-way there. RNs and RPNs are members of the College of Nurses. Nutrition Managers need to maintain CSNM and/or College of Dietitians memberships. For PSWs, FSWs, Cooks, Maintenance, Housekeeping, and Laundry workers, let's have a provincial registry maintaining records of qualifications, training, employment in the field, and disciplines (with appropriate sunset clauses). As an added bonus this will help keep people who have been terminated for abuse from re-entering the LTC system just by moving to another home.

Redevelopments should be planned as homes which provide medical support and care, rather than medical facilities that people live in - which is effectively what we've done for the most part so far. Plan for dementia villages and mixed-care settings where people can age in place, rather than moving from (private) retirement home to (partly funded) assisted living facility to (publicly funded) LTC home. We know that resident status tends to decline after each move, and moves take a lot of resources - both on the resident/family end and on the facility end. Let's minimize moves.

Where possible, integrate senior-care settings into other living settings. As an example, I saw an article a couple years ago about a facility in one of the Scandinavian countries which doubled as a university residence. Students could opt to live there - with free rent and meals provided by the facility in exchange for sharing the common areas with the LTC residents and committing to volunteer a certain number of hours each week in the home (feeding residents, assisting with activities, even just having conversations).

This one is probably the hardest, but a complete regulatory overhaul. Currently, in Ontario, LTC is the most heavily regulated industry besides nuclear power. However, the regulatory enforcement is not nearly as good (and some of the regulations are insane and create only paperwork). Inspectors I've seen tend to spend 75% of their time looking for documentation errors and gaps, rather than actually going up on the floors and looking at practice. I've gotten findings for using carrot rounds instead of diced carrots. A friend got a finding because they didn't have a HACCP recipe (with calculated nutritional information) on file for a slice of white bread with margarine and jam. But then you have cases like Wettlaufer where major medication errors were being made - and documented - and swept under the rug; and that failure of oversight allowed her to kill 8 people and make 6 more attempts.",fqofm1s,t3_gjql2r,1589514140,1589539340.0,/r/ontario/comments/gjql2r/how_do_we_make_senior_homes_better_lets_make_some/fqofm1s/,2020-05-15 03:42:20,2020-05

4199,CatpissEverqueef,ontario,"Graphed information is from Tables 3 and 4 of the daily Public Health Ontario Epidemiological Report. April 16th report is missing and therefore not shown.  

R^2 value on the trendline indicates how accurate the trendline is, closer to 1 is better. Poly trendline indicates exponential growth to a degree, even if it looks linear by eye.  

Where there are fluctuations in the data that don't make sense (i.e. where deaths go down), this is explained in the relevant epidemiological reports as revised data from the various Health Units. Over the bigger picture, these small fluctuations don't make a difference but do make the graph look silly in some areas.   

Yes, just realised I spelled Cumulative wrong in the second graph. No, I will not be changing it until next time I post the updated graph.  

Rightly or wrongly, I have generally been tracking deaths as a way of making decisions for myself and my family during this time, rather than cases. At this time I have started to split deaths down to two groupings, between LTC (Long term care), RH (Retirement Home) and Hospital deaths, and all others (which would effectively represent the remainder of society). Reason being there is an inordinately large number of institutionalized deaths due to this disease, and it is unfair to lump those deaths in with the remainder in looking at the trends, because those deaths come under vastly different circumstances (generally more likely to have co-morbidity, higher age bracket, and less likely to be able to avoid getting the disease).   

My conclusion is that both groups are still rising. Deaths due to outbreaks in LTC, RH, and Hospitals are increasing faster than the rest of society, but both are still increasing. Hospitalizations and ICU cases are also still both increasing, excel says more exponentially than linearly, but mostly linearly. None of the trends show a slow down or a decrease to me.  

So in making decisions for my family, I would expect that things are still going to get worse, albeit slowly, if we don't lift any of the current restrictions. If we start lifting restrictions, I would expect things to get worse a bit faster. It means just because Home Depot is open, doesn't mean I'm going. It means just because I can maybe combine households with another, doesn't mean I will. It means I'm still planning on being as extremely careful as I currently am, to protect myself and my family and do the best for my fellow citizen that I can in that regard.

4209,makemeasquare,alberta,"I have complicated feelings towards public service and the valuation of labour. On one hand it's a easier to compensate based on performance when there are financial metrics available. You made X value in sales, you retained X number of high-value clients, you processed x volume of shipments through your warehouse. There's often more tangible outcomes than there are in public service roles. 

In the public service, this is often not possible. Like, in the United States SOME states/districts tried to tie students' performance in standardized testing to teacher incomes because that was measurable. But that was inherently flawed because it created punishment/reward systems that furthered educational divides between rich and poor communities and, as a result, the racial educational chasm too. There's a lot of literature out there right now that says standardized testing isn't actually all that fair or unbaised, in terms of judging students' progress. 

Complicated issue. I definitely did not have the best experience with AUPE and I can sympathize with your comments about the fact that not everyone is logging in their best efforts. There are sincere structural problems that squeeze out innovation and some people really are just clocking down the years until retirement. But I didn't personally experience that on a large-scale - they certainly didn't comprise the majority of employees in the division I worked in.

I was under the impression you still had to pay personal taxes on anything your corporated business pays out - that's how our family trust works. That aside, I still think it's something that should be done AND if we brought our corporate taxes back in-line with the rest of Canada then I think we'd still recoup some of the funds. Our corporate taxes are also too low, owing to the UCP cuts/planned cuts following their election. Our poorly spaced brackets simultaneously overtax high-income earners and punish low-income earners anyway.

It's going to take a lame-duck government to restructure taxes in Alberta, though because that shit is extremely unpopular. The NDP implemented tax brackets after they were elected and the UCP argued for scrapping them during the election and returning to the flat-tax model - though they've been mighty quiet since.

Some live in unsafe retirement and care homes.  Some have to keep going out because there's no one to help.  And not everyone can access delivery options because of cost or regional availability.

And for those who are not yet retired, it's not realistic to think that they won't need to go back to work to support themselves.  Most people of working age don't have the resources to take that kind of time off and many jobs can't be done remotely.  Will the government support them indefinitely until the crisis is over?  Would you support that?  Or would that be too great a burden as well?  Just like it's too great a burden for you to stay inside for a bit?

4214,24-Hour-Hate,ontario,"It wouldn't be if people had a problem with other instances of such noise.  But people routinely accept other exceptions or violations of the noise by-law as being reasonable or simply something that happens in a community.  A good example, one I would have included in my previous comment had I thought of it when I wrote it, is the car parades currently happening.   

Now, up front I want to say that I'm not saying that these parades are bad or that anyone involved has bad intent.

However, let's look at the law and be honest.  Driving very slowly on the road and honking your horn is not legal.  It's a violation of noise by-laws and the HTA.  

And, if you were a person living in an area where such an event happened, especially if it was happening regularly (ex. hospital, LTC home, retirement home, etc.), it's reasonable to believe you'd find it very disruptive.

The repetitive sound of horns honking is very loud and abrasive.  It would definitely prevent people from sleeping and disrupt their enjoyment of peace and quiet.  Also, these parades can be quite long and cause traffic congestion, so it could prevent a person from being able to leave their home when they need to get to work or purchase essential goods, for example.  Or even returning home after a long shift.  And, unlike the prayer, they are not scheduled at a set time, so you can't avoid them or take precautions.

Now, I haven't heard anyone complaining about these parades.  In fact, I've heard many people praising the people who do them for supporting healthcare workers, finding ways to celebrate with family, and so on.

All I'm saying is that if we're prepared to make allowances and let some people break the law because of the current circumstances, then it comes off as bigoted if we decide that a particular group in society isn't entitled to exactly the same consideration.  Particularly when said group has actually bothered to seek to do it legally - i.e. get an exemption from the noise by-law - when others have just gone ahead and broken the law, expecting that they won't be punished.

4224,leaguestories123,ontario,"Doesn’t putting money in people’s pocket incentivize businesses to employ people and create jobs as a way to compete for the newly created money. 

If people don’t have jobs the money will obviously be saved for essentials like rent and food but even buying those things help stimulate the economy in a way. If you don’t pay you rent than your property manager can’t pay the freelancer that did some landscaping and it pulls out the economic chain on everyone.

If everybody has money at least businesses have some opportunity to create value to drive revenue. Nobody is going to a movie theatre obviously but creative and innovative ways to create value should always be supported.

Obviously support companies who can’t create value or are viable and having their businesses harmed. But I don’t think companies who take risky positions should get rewarded at all, especially if they bought their own stock, just sell it.

Heads I win and tails you bail me out is a recipe for disastrous risky behavior.

I think you’re too hard on the stimulus. The only thing that will keep people employed is cash flows. If you’re projected to lose money on an employee and you get a loan, you can still fire them. Stimulating the economy through consumers allows for the consumers to have more confidence and will raise the demand enough that suppliers can compete in a meaningful way that requires employing people for positive cash flows.

I hear the pension/retirement argument all the time and you forget a fundamental truth. The market recovers and it always does, and if you’re retired or close to retired please be in bonds or you’re being too risky with your money.

The average American only has $6,000 saved for retirement and I get that retired Americans are important but let’s not pretend that there’s a ton of equity there.

So in conclusion consumers with cash that want to buy stuff is a better incentive than giving businesses money and having nobody wanting to buy stuff.

Also if you’re young your retirement fund will recover well, time in the market always wins.

&gt; But it’s not that simple. Why?

&gt; The fact is, a series of delays, inconsistencies and gaps in Ontario’s COVID-19 data reporting mean neither we nor the province can answer a question about ongoing community spread with anything much better than a ballpark estimate.

&gt; On Monday, Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, said trends suggest about 45 per cent of the 370 cases reported that day were in long-term care homes, meaning the remaining 55 per cent were “probably” in the community. But, he stressed, officials wouldn’t know this for sure until “about six or seven days from now.”

&gt; Williams told the Star that this delay is due to the fact that the regional public health units have not been entering the results of their investigations into how people may have contracted the virus and who they came into contact with until the probes are complete — a process that can take several days.",fpp21jq,t3_geoons,1588794589,1588819789.0,/r/ontario/comments/geoons/more_businesses_allowed_to_reopen_in_ontario_ford/fpp21jq/,2020-05-06 19:49:49,2020-05

Why make a name for yourself when one of the thousand other employees can take your spot if they get rid of you? These people probably feel as expendable as the animals they slaughter.


&gt;Days before the reopening, the union surveyed more than 600 workers in four languages; 85 per cent said they were afraid to return to work.

I don't blame them. We had the Minister of Agriculture Devin Dreeshen say on a tele-townhall on April 19th, where he said the meat plant was safe, along with our Chief Medical Officer. That reassurance it was safe came a day before the first death, and 2 days before the plant closed down. It seems like the government dropped the ball pretty much the entire way. From the video inspection done by Alberta Occupational Health and Safety, to the assurance it was safe to work there from the Minister.  Caught between a company who holds your job over your head and the government telling you everything is OK, 85% saying they feel it's unsafe should've been listened to.

&gt;Cargill Ltd. is a Canadian subsidiary of the U.S.-based Cargill, which reported revenue of $113.5 billion US and net earnings of $2.56 billion last year.

&gt;The company is the largest private company in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and the Cargills, a family of reclusive billionaires, still own more than 90 per cent of the corporation.

&gt;Wages at the Cargill plant start at $17.95 per hour, according to the collective agreement.

I don't understand how old age facilities are being taken over by the government for mishandling the virus, why these meat plants should get a pass? Would a company owned and operated solely in Canada feel more responsibility to take care of their workers? Is it time for Canada to take the side of their Canadian employees over the multinational or international massive companies who seem to only care about their yearly revenues?


&gt;""They called my husband, the [Cargill] nurse called, but he still has symptoms,"" one worker said of her husband, who is also an employee. ""They said, ‘That’s only flu, that’s only cough. You’re fit to work.’""

They could have been more severe on people who had symptoms and ran the plant at a reduced capacity. It seems like they were trying to get as much out of their employees as possible and also doing the tiniest amount at protecting them or preventing the outbreak from worsening. As a business, wouldn't you rather have your plant running at a reduced capacity for 14 days, rather than the majority of your workforce getting the virus and having to shut down for 14 days? Huge companies regularly will do risk/reward simulations for things that are ethically dubious. I'm sure they worked out the numbers must have figured it wouldn't affect their bottom line as much as sending sick people home.

&gt;On Monday, the same day the Cargill plant reopened after a two-week closure, Bui’s memorial service was livestreamed on social media.

&gt;Bui’s husband of more than 25 years, Nga Nguyen — who also works at Cargill and contracted COVID-19 — was asked whether Cargill had called him to express its condolences.

&gt;On Tuesday, the day after CBC News spoke to Keating, the company said it had reached out to Nguyen to offer condolences.

Public relations after the fact is just that, only public relations. A company who cares about their employees would've expressed sympathy and their condolences immediately. For those interested in law, most Canadian provinces and territories, with the exceptions of Québec and Yukon, have now adopted an ""apology legislation."" It typically provides that an apology: does not constitute an admission of fault or liability. Alberta has this, so it isn't the excuse that the company was fearful of litigation, it's just callousness. 


&gt;The outbreak at Cargill has spread into the greater community. Cases among staff at a High River retirement facility and on a nearby First Nation have been traced back to the plant.

Isolated to the meat plant, if all employees lived there, that would be one thing. Still sad and a huge outbreak, but it would be isolated to the meat plant itself and not spread. But these people didn't live at the plant. A lot lived in South Calgary. Where they took it home to their families, spread it while going on errands, and now we can trace other cases happening at a retirement facility and a First Nations. Who is culpable here? Who is to blame? Who will pay the price if the outbreak worsens due to the ineptitude of the Government of Alberta and the people who own Cargill? Ordinary people will pay the price with one already dead and both the government and the meatplant will wash their hands of it saying ""we did the best we could"", when they did _nothing_.",fpndv55,t3_gegh2v,1588759450,1588784650.0,/r/alberta/comments/gegh2v/north_americas_biggest_covid19_outbreak_happened/fpndv55/,2020-05-06 10:04:10,2020-05

1. Canadian business opportunities are abundant, but there can be a lot of resistance to development.  This is due to a lack of the entrepreneurial culture as you described.  

Example: Sechelt, a town with world class diving, has no dive center; and Vancouver has maybe a handful of sub-par waterfront dining options.  Unthinkable situations, from an American perspective.

2. For retirement, retraining, or any sort of social security net?  Canadians will complain to no end about lack of social services and healthcare, but compared to the US?  No comparison.  I'd want to be here if I was injured, or had any other sort of health, mental health, or other deterioration.

3. With regards to your complaints around some of America's attitude problems?  I honestly find most canadians are not as different from Americans as they think, and vice-versa.  The differences are more superficial than practical - you will notice more in conversation that in practice.

4. The last pertinent thing in your decision is real estate.  Canada has two options: cheap and far from any job, or too expensive for your job to pay for.

4244,eatplasticwater,britishcolumbia,"Thanks for bringing that up. Definitely an issue, and something I have considered.

I have asked myself if I am morally justified in leaving Canada for my prime income earning years and then coming back to cash in on the social services. But that's not what I'm doing. 

I WANT to contribute to society. I enjoy doing volunteer work with the community. I want to start a small business. I want to pay crazy high Canadian taxes! Without a social safety net, it is much harder to do those things in the States (except the taxes part). 

Here you work 50 weeks a year, you hope you don't get sick (bankruptcy), you hope your retirement (which is all in the stock market) doesn't evaporate into corrupt bankers' pockets, and you hope it all works out so you can enjoy whatever you have left over in your retirement.",fpki0lo,t3_gdxy73,1588695053,1588720253.0,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/gdxy73/rant_from_an_expat_wanting_to_come_home/fpki0lo/,2020-05-05 16:10:53,2020-05

We don't have any concerns about him (except for normal ones, in a pandemic)...one of the reasons that my parents moved up there 30 years ago was because of the amazing community that they were moving into.  My mom's been gone for a while, but Dad's neighbours check in on him at least once every day- weather permitting, they set up lawn chairs and have a chat.  And they stack his wood for his wood stove and move what's necessary inside, do his shopping for him when they do theirs, and the local restaurants and some of the camp grounds are sending a few meals a week out to seniors just so that they don't have to cook every night. And not too many people are sick up there, so he can still go to his regular doctors' appointments etc.

I agree that we're going to see people die from poverty and illnesses related to poverty for MANY years to come, which is why I don't understand why the gov is willing to spend hundreds of billions on keeping people at home instead of working on:

1. Locking down the hardest hit places and ensuring testing for them (LTC/Retirement)
2. Getting proper PPE out to doctors and nurses so they can keep working. The coverings we have here are insufficient compared to SK.
3. Increasing our hospital capacity in the short term so everyone still gets the same treatment, which is about the best we can give them rn. If we're only at 30% capacity rn, we can handle roughly 1200 cases a day at peak in our current state of capacity, considering our peak was a week ago. 

End of the day, the virus is gonna kill people, it's just nature. But we can make sure everyone gets the same treatment. 

One thing about masks tho, yeah I know we can still get it even if wearing a mask but there's a direct correlation between the viral load inhaled and likelihood of infection/severe infection. So if we reduce how much viral load is getting out into the world, we slow down spread and have fewer hospitalizations.

4256,GrabbinPills,ontario,"&gt;  the difference in care between retirement homes and nursing homes

Retirement homes (a 'fancy' apartment building that provides some senior-friendly services) and nursing homes (officially Long Term Care facilities regulated by the Ministry of Health) are often conflated and it is especially hard to disambiguate since some LTC homes also have a ""retirement floor/wing/building"" and some retirement homes have full LTC nursing floors. One management company may own several LTC nursing homes and retirement homes so the whole situation is a convoluted mess.

On paper, retirement homes are for individuals who are still mostly independent in their daily living tasks. LTC / nursing homes are primarily for individuals that need significant amounts of complex medical care from on site registered nurses and/or 24/7 help with daily living tasks.",fphw5qz,t3_gdhyfa,1588628912,1588654112.0,/r/ontario/comments/gdhyfa/the_private_sector_cannot_be_trusted_to_care_for/fphw5qz/,2020-05-04 21:48:32,2020-05

4259,CaptainSur,ontario,"Harris did indeed make major moves to deregulate LTC in Ontario.  Most LTC now are owned by funds, and they bring in management companies to be the operators, just like how many hotel chains are run.  Chartwell for example is at its heart a real estate investment trust.

The sole goal of a REIT, even an LTC REIT is to generate cash flow.  But they are also inefficient in several metrics such as executive and upper management compensation.  Nor do they enjoy the same purchasing power as government (although governments have not always been very good at obtaining their best efficiencies either though I do believe this metric has improved). 

Private standards are definitely much inferior to public health institutions of any type in respect of health outcomes.

Private operators make a good chunk of their money by operating at low staff levels and employing most on a part time basis with lower pay scales and benefits.

I was a real estate banker for several yrs (meaning I financed construction for residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects).  Including construction loans for retirement facilities of many different operators.  Reit operators are always professional and slick at the corporate level.  And its not that they are evil or ill intentioned.  But their goal is profit.  And to be public about as little as possible.

One solution that needs to be implemented is that politicians should be permanently forbidden from subsequently working for their benefactors.  The more senior the position in government, the more strict the rules should be.

I favour having all care homes being government operated.  I think all should have standards for number of full RNs, RPN's, RNA's and other staff that should be on hand.  I think all staff should be employees of govt, assigned to a single property.  They should be managed by a small central team that is heavily virtualized.  If all were employees of a central govt dept then also they could be reassigned easily - it would be part of their employee obligation.   But pay, training and benefits would be dealt with in a more even handed and sensible manner.

I think the same should be true of many working in hospitals.  Instead of being an employee of the hospital they should be employees of the province.  A lot of HR savings could be achieved.

I am not suggesting that just because they are employees of the province they should be abused and constantly reassigned willy nilly (although there are actually public sector jobs where this occurs) as stability is important especially in health roles.

There was nothing the Harris government touched that it did not corrupt.  Don't even get me started on Hwy 407 or Ontario Hydro, both of whom I had direct financing exposure to as a very senior banker.  The stench of it was such that I have never voted Conservative since.  Nor have many of my banking peers - even though a lot of us were instrumental in putting the Harris govt in power via various fundraising activities.  The Common Sense revolution was anything but.  An MPP of the Harris govt for whom I actively campaigned door to door every night for weeks was himself so disgusted with its ethics that he eventually ended up on the outs with his own govt.

I would suggest that a major reason the Cons lost and never got back in for almost 2 decades as all the Bay street crowd turned their backs on the Conservatives.    Most swung their support to the Liberals after witnessing several really deplorable (even by malleable banker standards...) actions.",fphq530,t3_gdfvzr,1588625764,1588650964.0,/r/ontario/comments/gdfvzr/source_in_comments/fphq530/,2020-05-04 20:56:04,2020-05

As another Reddit person has posted, there can be frequent miscommunication and misdirection as to what we can do, how many times per week to check in with families, what to give feedback to, to plan accordingly for our IEP and ELL/ESL students, how many times to have Zoom meetings with admin and colleagues and to use professional judgement when it comes to having Google Hangouts with our students. Or not to have any Google Hangouts with students. And to document the dates, times and mode of communication used to connect with families - each family, minimum twice per week. 

I also have to have two separate Zoom meetings with two different grade divisions because I am a split class. I's not easy but I try my best to find balance. Each meeting has been a minimum of two hours each. Planning distance learning takes so much longer that when I am in the school building, with my colleagues. I have a few binders and zero math and literacy materials. To say that this has been challenging is an understatement. The additional hours it takes each week to plan distance learning is double from what I was used to when I worked in the classroom. Nobody wants to be out of the classroom - the students, the teachers and the community. It's a stressful situation and one we had no control over. 

Add to the mix that the Minister of Education goes straight to the podium without so much as consulting school boards and teachers first, then spouts whatever rhetoric comes to mind, or what's been prepared for him and he makes himself look like a fool. How about Lecce actually acknowledge that teachers are the ones doing the planning and implementation? He's done nothing for us that's been helpful or productive during this. We're the ones that have hit the ground running. It hasn't been easy - and there are teachers who've just returned back from a maternity leave, or medical leave, or who are years within retirement or who are just about to retire and they've had to adapt to a whole different skill set. That's not easy and not every teacher is tech savvy. I won't be forgetting any time soon that Lecce was using all his social media platforms to bash us teachers for the past 6 months.  

I'm incredibly appreciative of the fact that I have a job that I can do from home and I get paid for, but to suggest that it's been easy or that we have a free ride is frustrating. As a teacher, Lecce should just say that the school year is done with - in terms of not being allowed back into the building - but we can continue with the distance learning until the last week of June 2020. As for the health and safety aspect, schools are not conducive to social distancing. Who knows what September is going to bring. I'll feel a lot better when there's news of an actual vaccine.

Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, could be living with the security of family immediately nearby were granny flats universally allowed and the gazillion municipal obstacles removed.
2. Increase stay at home care workforce and stop jobbing it out with all the agencies acting as middleman.  Although a worker can only visit and help so many in a day, and perhaps even only one person depending on the patient it still is a lot cheaper then bricks and mortar construction and carrying/maintenance costs.
3. Create a retirement vehicle where an individual specifically can set aside costs not for ""retirement"" but for care in their oldest and least functional years.  There should be no tax on money put into or withdrawn.

Reclamation can be done along the way.  My concern with decommissioning work is it really needs to be addressed correctly by the government.  Big companies either will need strict regulations to follow on what the expectations are (thus we end up with the current abandoned well situation) or provided some sort of economical benefit to decommissioning (I prefer the regulations, so that companies have 20 odd years to plan for that financially).

4352,Dr_Fangorn,alberta,"The complex modifier removal is not the only funding model change that impacts family physicians, albeit is likely the most utilized code that the government impacted by family physicians. There are multiple reasons why these physicians in Rocky Mountain House are following the pattern seen in other communities such as Rimbey and Sundre.

The government has reduced the remuneration paid to most physicians who do not pay overhead to AHS or the University clinics in the province for the services that they provide in an acute care centre, such as a hospital emergency room. The fee paid to a family physician covering an emergency department has been cut from $38.03 for an ER visit (03.03A)  to $31.00 (03.03AZ), an 18.5% pay cut to provide more complex and time consuming care than is required for an in-office primary care visit.

Secondly, all provincial medical associations are funded by their provincial health authorities to subsidize most of the costs of these premiums through negotiated agreements. When the Alberta government tore up the Master Agreement with the AMA, it cut the subsidization of these premiums by approximately 50%. It now costs all physicians more out of their gross billings to cover the costs of their medical liability insurance, which they must have in order to be able to practice. The most affected specialties are obstetrics and gynecology ($48,000/yr) and neurosurgery &amp; orthopedics ($25,700/yr). The government pays an obstetrician $500 to deliver a baby. With the subsidy cut in half, an obstetrician now has to deliver at least 48 babies a year in order to cover the costs of their insurance, without taking into account their overhead and income taxes!

Thirdly, the government has made it infinitely harder to recruit and retain physicians in smaller communities with their changes. Alberta Health has taken an old move out of a failed playbook by controlling the provision of a billing number to new physicians to the province. If you were an immigrating physician or a newly minted Canadian family physician, who in their right mind would be told where they would have to practice for an undetermined time with possible spouses and children's well being to consider? With the signing of Bill 10, the Health Minister, by ministerial order, can change the rules however they see fit now without any debate in the legislature. Bill 10 applies to all areas of government in the province, not just Health. 

Despite the government's byline that physician remuneration remains at the highest amount across the country, the devil is in the details. There's three sides to the story - there's the government's spin, there's the AMA's spin on behalf of the physicians, and then there's the truth in-between. Medicine is a business, no question, and there are big expenses to run a practise - overhead encompasses rent/mortage, utilities, professional association fees, liability insurance costs, and staffing costs (clinic nurses, receptionists), to name a few. Then there's the federal and provincial income taxes, for both the corporation as well as what the physician draws off personally. A newly minted Canadian physician has a median debt of $100,000 (Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada data) to pay off, as well as fund their retirement 20-30 years down the road. All of this comes from that $38.03 routine visit fee. Or $31.00 if that physician sees you in the emergency room.",fo1bdz5,t3_g53vj4,1587429638,1587454838.0,/r/alberta/comments/g53vj4/rocky_medical_clinic_also_cutting_hospital/fo1bdz5/,2020-04-21 00:40:38,2020-04

4359,ninjaoftheworld,ontario,"There’s good unions and bad ones and good experiences and bad. They’re only as useful as the people running them, the membership involvements, the collective agreements. I’ve only ever had excellent experience with the four unions I’ve worked with in my career, but I know people in my same local who’ve had bad. I do know that without the union I’d have no benefits, no decent bargaining power, and—I work in a gig industry—no ability to contact the other people who do what I do in a meaningful way to find out how their working conditions are, how their pay compares to mine, what’s fair to ask for in terms of kit rentals, etc. 

I think the union’s usefulness depends largely on how and when you yourself use it. I’m a pretty light involvement kinda guy, I use maybe 10% of the non-mainline benefits, but I share an office with people who use 90% so I’m cool having them on the list. I suspect as a young person working at a grocery chain, you probably didn’t have much use for what they provided—statistically, you were probably healthy, and not super involved in things like retirement planning, and likely looking forward to a very different future.

Otherwise the union becomes weak and slowly dies as veteran members retire.

In recent decades we've seen sunset clauses implemented in many public sector union CBAs that secure employment/wages/benefits/pensions for veteran employees while leaving those with lesser seniority or new hires with significantly reduced remuneration and job stability. Eg lower wages and less liklihood of full-time employment so as to be classified as part-time in a two-tier system.

Basically, instead of negotiating for and ratifying agreements which see minor concessions to all employees, veteran public sector union management/employees have in many cases agreed to significant concessions for those with lower seniority in order to protect the end-of-career years and benefits for veterans. Hence the term sunset clause... veterans are sent into the sunset to retire while the remnants are left with the sun down on remuneration which the union had previously established.

This is essentially a union cannibalizing itself... and we're seeing it frequently as public sector job security fades.",fnqoh7i,t3_g34mgq,1587168759,1587193959.0,/r/ontario/comments/g34mgq/two_tier_pay/fnqoh7i/,2020-04-18 00:12:39,2020-04

4379,IHateClickingLinks,ontario,"**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

&gt;Ontario reported 514 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, a six per cent increase that brings the provincial total to nearly 9,000 since the outbreak began in late January. 

&gt;The province also completed 9,001 tests since its last update on the novel coronavirus, topping the target of 8,000 daily tests by today that was set last week.

&gt;There is, however, an important caveat for the testing figures provided today.

&gt;On Wednesday, public health officials changed how they are counting tests. Previously, they reported how many people were being tested each day. Now, they are reporting how many samples are being processed each day.

&gt;That means that some of the 9,001 samples could have come from, for example, the existing testing backlog or from hospitalized patients, from whom a minimum of two samples are collected and processed by labs. It does not mean that 9,001 more people were tested since the last update.

&gt;Further, the change makes it impossible for the public to know how many people in Ontario have been tested for the novel coronavirus.

&gt;For the first time ever, the majority of Thursday's new cases come from long-term care homes. Of the 514 new cases 271 are in long-term care homes and 243 are in the community.

&gt;Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said this is due to more testing and expanded criteria for testing in long-term care homes. He also said the fact that community cases have stayed under 300 on Thursday is a hopeful sign that the curve is flattening.

&gt;""Travel-related cases are pretty well gone and social and physical distancing is making an impact; we're bending the curve,"" Williams said at his daily update on Thursday.  

&gt;Ontario's official death toll from COVID-19 now sits at 423, though CBC News has collected data from regional public health units and counted at least 501 deaths across the province. Nearly 4,200 cases that have been resolved.

&gt;The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 rose slightly, from 795 to 807. Meanwhile, those in intensive care units dropped to 248 from 254. But the number of cases on ventilators — an important factor in how hospitals are able to cope with the influx of COVID-19 patients — increased from 188 to 200. 

&gt;The growth in total cases has been relatively low for about a week, and Ontario health officials have said the peak is expected this week. Some 980 cases are health-care workers. 

&gt;Included in today's official report from the province are the following figures regarding Ontario's 626 long-term care facilities:

&gt;In a letter sent to Ontario hospitals Wednesday, the province said it is now issuing a ""temporary pause"" on transitioning hospital patients to long-term care and retirement homes.

&gt;""With hospital acute care capacity across Ontario at 64.1 per cent as of April 13, we believe hospitals can continue to
care for these patients safely given the risk of COVID-19 in LTC and retirement home settings,"" the letter reads.

&gt;At his daily briefing on Thursday, Premier Ford said the province has added 2,000 acute and critical care beds to hospitals in Ontario and plans to add another 4,200 by April 30. 

&gt;Earlier this week, the province issued an emergency order prohibiting employees from working at multiple long-term care facilities in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. CBC News has confirmed however that temporary workers are still being allowed to work in more than one facility.

&gt;Ford described long-term care homes as the ""front lines of this battle,"" and explained that ""medical SWAT teams"" had been deployed to the homes that need it the most. 

&gt;""We're bringing in the very, very best. Specialists who are trained in the detection, prevention and containment of the world's most deadliest diseases,"" Ford said on Thursday. 

&gt;In the last 24 hours, five hospitals worked together to help 38 long-term care homes in need, according to Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Ontario's minister of long-term care.

&gt;""This is the model that we will be expanding across the province,"" Fullerton said. 

&gt;The Markhaven Home for Seniors in Markham, Ont. counted its 12th and 13th COVID-19-related deaths. The residents were both women. One was 102; the other was 92.

&gt;""We are all heartbroken over more sad news,"" Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti tweeted Thursday.

&gt;""Our thoughts are with the families of two residents ... Another tough day in our community.""

&gt;The hard-hit Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke confirmed one more death due to COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total to 31. The number of positive cases is now 79, with 80 test results pending. 

&gt;""Our home has been supportive of Public Health's decision to test all of our residents,"" wrote Executive Director Evelyn MacDonald in a statement.

&gt;""Through expanded testing, we will have a clearer picture of the scope of the outbreak within our home. We expect to get additional test results back over the coming days and, as always, we will personally call the families of any residents who are COVID-19 positive,"" the statement continued.

&gt;Thursday evening, Altamont Care Community confirmed the death of one of its workers at its Scarborough location.

&gt;""Today we received the difficult news of the passing of a much-loved and valued team member from Altamont Care Community,"" communications director Natalie Gokchenian said in a statement. 

&gt;On behalf of the entire team at Sienna Senior Living, we extend our deepest condolences to her family, loved ones, and colleagues.""

&gt;A coalition of child-care advocates is calling on the province to offer financial assistance to providers across Ontario to ensure none close permanently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt;The Coalition for Better Child Care says many of the centres, which are closed and not collecting fees during the pandemic, have laid off staff and are having trouble paying their bills.

&gt;The group is asking the province to provide emergency funds to the centres to replace the fees normally paid by parents.

&gt;Last week, Ontario's education minister said the province would prevent child-care centres from collecting payments while they're closed due to the pandemic.

&gt;Education Minister Stephen Lecce says he is working with both the federal and municipal governments to ensure the child-care system remains sustainable.

&gt;Some child-care centres that are looking after the children of health-care and other front-line workers have remained open, but the rest have been shuttered due to the pandemic.

&gt;Ontario is also expanding its testing for COVID-19 priority groups, including for residents and staff of homeless shelters and group homes, people living with health-care workers and cancer patients.

&gt;A spokeswoman for Health Minister Christine Elliott said the new guidelines will help Ontario take full advantage of the testing capacity it has built, and will help the province more effectively identify and contain cases among vulnerable populations.

&gt;The new guidelines say people living and working in ""congregate"" settings such as homeless shelters, correctional facilities and group homes should be tested as soon as possible if they have symptoms such as fever, pneumonia or ""any new or worsening symptom.""

&gt;Essential workers, cross-border workers, and people living with health-care workers, care providers and first responders are also now to be tested as soon as possible if they develop symptoms.

&gt;The guidelines also say people who need to be in frequent contact with the health system, including cancer patients, people undergoing dialysis and pregnant women should be tested as soon as they develop symptoms.

&gt;Symptoms are now defined as fever, pneumonia, ""any new or worsening symptom"" such as cough or shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, or nasal congestion, hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, new smell or taste disorders, nausea, vomiting, diahrrea, or abdominal pain.

&gt;Testing asymptomatic people is still not recommended, except for newborns whose mothers have COVID-19.

&gt;A second resident of a facility for adults with developmental and physical disabilities in Markham, Ont., has died, according to her family.

&gt;Earl Baird told CBC News that his sister, Patricia ""Patty"" Baird, passed away Wednesday afternoon. Patricia had lived at Participation House for more than five years, he said. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, he added.

&gt;""We all know of this dreadful virus — now our family has been personally affected,"" Baird wrote in a Facebook post.

&gt;""I cannot describe the pure love and a heart that our universe could not contain that was within Patty.""

&gt;Earlier this week, administrators at the home said that 37 of its 42 residents had tested positive for COVID-19, as well as 12 staff members.",fnn22eu,t3_g2qu7d,1587082755,1587107955.0,/r/ontario/comments/g2qu7d/ontario_confirms_514_new_covid19_cases_pushing/fnn22eu/,2020-04-17 00:19:15,2020-04

4397,Foxer604,britishcolumbia,"&gt; A permanent state of collapse and uncertainty is the ideal operating environment for statists and totalitarians.

i'm not sure there should be. That's Canadians buying Canadian properties. Why would we put an extra tax on that? Most of those places will go up for rent - something we desperately need. That sounds like more of a regressive than progressive tax. 

&gt;If this is your 2nd property, then you pay 40% sales + 10% property tax.

and jack up rental prices by 50%??  how is that making things better?

&gt;We also have issues with trusts buying property. CRA can't investigate the owners of these trusts because of privacy laws. An investor skirts around taxations by routing the ownership through Trusts.

they can. That's one of many many ways. 

&gt;Boomers also have way more liquidity and credit. They will totally flood the property markets with bids because of extremely easy access to credits.

boomers are selling their properties and downsizing. They're not buying up large amounts of extra properties. For most boomers, retirement is selling their 2 million dollar house in north van and buying a 300k townhome in abbotsford or parksville. They're not acquiring properties in large numbers. 

&gt;All of the above are a sizeable chunk of the property market. Way bigger than foreign buyers.

well even bigger than all of that is money laundering. 

But seriously - prices aren't going to go down significantly other than perhaps for very short periods. About the best that can be achieved is slow growth, perhaps even very slow growth. So people need to get used to that and get innovative. 

the only way housing goes down at all is if there's massive construction of new places, and that would mean serious changes to how the gov't does business. Which is unlikely. As long as developers are hindered in putting up a building, there's going to be a lack of product and that means higher prices.",fnbik8d,t3_g0nmdl,1586816155,1586841355.0,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/g0nmdl/bc_should_revise_housing_policy_must_be_canadian/fnbik8d/,2020-04-13 22:15:55,2020-04
4398,SunDX,PEI,"I moved here 6 years ago roughly from Montreal to study at upei. I love the island and have lived here ever since graduation. It’s a different experience for everyone, but most islanders are very friendly and amicable and on top of all humane. It is what the reputation is and it drives locals and foreigners to behave in the same manner. It doesn’t mean there are no situations where racism, homophobia or such occur. Overall, in my personal experience, I’ve encountered maybe 2 or 3 times blatant acts of racism that weren’t pleasant but keep in mind this is over the course of 6 years. I’ve had much more pleasant experiences with people that I am more than grateful for. This was one of the deciding factors for me to stay here post-graduation. And many other friends of mine who were ‘foreigners’ share the same thoughts.

It is wonderful, summer is incredible if you’re into hiking, exploring hidden gems of nature, culinary experiences (seafood mainly and of course the potatoes) or just tanning on the best beaches of Canada. It is rural, for the downtown has lots of shops covering needs for everyday living but there’s no luxury shopping really, which drove many younger city-folks away. But hey, online shopping and there’s always Halifax 3 hours away for that stuff. It’s quiet definitely. Compared to other cities of Canada or even UK I dare to guess, pei is quiet, retirement kind of quiet if one wants.

&gt;  income splitting for couples with children was a move that recognized

I'm aware of income splitting. Again, it benefits people who have lucrative jobs the most. It's also a very good tax dodge for high income earners. They can distribute their income to their low income spouse, and suddenly less taxes are paid. Again, great if you are applicable, not so great if you are living paycheque to paycheque as it is. Not that it doesn't have its benefits, but it certainly doesn't assist anyone who is already struggling.

&gt; Two working couples, both with young children. All four work full time, but couple 1 is a mechanic making $80k, and a cashier making $20k, and couple 2 is made up of two municipal civil servants, both pulling $50k. Couple A pays significantly more in income taxes than couple B. How much sense does that make?.

$80000 = $20556 in taxes
$20000 = $1997 in taxes
Total tax = $22553

$50000 = $11086 in taxes
Total tax = $22172

Numbers pulled from https://neuvoo.ca/tax-calculator/ since they have a handy tax calculator that corresponded to my income tax accurately.

How exactly is this significantly more? This is as false as false can be. They pay about the same in taxes. The benefit comes when people are making high 6 figures or more; ie. already high income earners. It's mainly a tax dodge to reduce your income from high brackets to low brackets. I suggest you get your facts straight and stop spreading this bullshit.

&gt; Have you considered that reducing costs makes them more sustainable in the long run

I have and yet see no evidence of this. Since Kenney's government has come in, I've seen my property taxes increase, my insurance premiums increase, my daycare costs have gone up, and my services decreased. I'm also concerned that my eldest is going to start Kindergarten (hopefully) this September and will have a class size of 26/27 with no assistance for the teacher. It's absolutely bonkers that anyone would consider this acceptable, or frankly, even safe. But the right has lead us here, so here we are.

Have you considered ""cost reduction"" is nothing more than a con to make us race to the bottom so the 1% can hoard more wealth? Do you need any more evidence of this than looking at the southern states in the US? They are sick, uneducated, hostile, and bigoted. But hey, low taxes!

&gt; ...they've chosen bad ways more often than I'd like to admit, but that's a question of competence...

No, that's naive. This is by design. The sooner you and other right voters come to this conclusion, the sooner WE ALL will be better off. And if you felt it was a question of competence, do you plan to hold them accountable? Are Shandro's current actions a question of competence or are they corrupt? What about Switzer? Kenney stealing the UCP leadership, how is that a question of competence? At what point do you (and other blue voters) hold these people accountable? Why do they get a pass, but Notely's government was crucified over Bill 6, and the global oil price? They were competent, but the right kicked them out.

I'm not naive enough to buy their bullshit. You seem fairly intelligent so I will simply ask this: if you (and by that I really mean conservatives who want ""small government"") truly believe this is all just a matter of a difference of opinion and the conservative way is ideal, are you willing to move somewhere where conservative ideals are exemplified the most? Lowest taxes, lowest regulations, highest personal accountability? If so, I will gladly purchase you and your family tickets to Somalia or Ethiopia. I'm certain you will find everything conservatives value.",fmez7bj,t3_fu842b,1586016688,1586041888.0,/r/alberta/comments/fu842b/school_boards_disagree_with_kenney_about_layoffs/fmez7bj/,2020-04-04 16:11:28,2020-04
4447,SoitDroitFait,alberta,"My goodness, you're an unpleasant one, aren't you?

&gt;If you can make a reasonable argument that supports the fact that people who identify as conservative voters aren’t ignorant, panicky, fearful, stubborn or hostile to new/different ideas/people, and do so using sourced articles with peer reviewed data, by all means, do so.

I don't need to. I'm not challenging the traits; I'm using exactly the same traits you are. I'm just not putting as negative a spin about how to characterize the combination. Are they less educated *on average*? Yes, absolutely, and they also tend to work with concrete ideas and situations instead of abstract ideals. Do they prefer their established way of life to something new or different? They do. Why is that? Because they like it, damn it, and they tend to trust that things are the way they are for cogent reasons, not all of which are horrible, not all of which we're always even aware of, and they're anxious about the potential consequences of changing those things, even if they agree they're not ideal, because they know it can get a lot worse even with everyone acting in good faith. 

&gt;If you can demonstrate that said traits are beneficial to an educated, relatively technologically advanced, diverse and rapidly changing society, do so.

If you can demonstrate that a sober second thought is irrelevant, do so. Any character trait, if cultivated poorly, can become a vice (ex. attention to detail can become pedantry; confidence can become arrogance; dedication into zealotry). The vast majority of conservative voters I know are genuinely decent, compassionate people, who think Canada's a wonderful place, generally do support public education and healthcare (though some of the wealthier ones would like to see a parallel private option) and what they think of as reasonable immigration levels, but are concerned about the consequences of changing too much too quickly, or changing certain institutions that they see as fundamental to society. People who care deeply about their communities and the people in them. Those same character traits are active in xenophobes, bigots, classists, and the like as well -- but that doesn't make everyone sharing those traits into the worst possible expression of them.

&gt;Wouldn’t public healthcare, public education, and a mosaic culture be traditionally Canadian?

2/3 have only been around since, like, the 60s, so I'm not sure I'd call them ""traditionally Canadian"", but I'd agree that they're expressions of *values* we consider traditionally Canadian, yes.

&gt;Aren’t these things conservatives in Canada are actively destroying? 

The only conservative government in Canada I'm aware of that actually seems to want to *destroy* them is Kenney's. The others, like Harper's federally, or Pallister's provincially, are/were certainly trying to contain costs, and admittedly not always in ways I agree with, but I think it's a bit much to suggest they were ""trying to destroy"" public healthcare or education. There are certainly differences on immigration policy in Canada, but apart from a couple notable examples that received censure even from many conservatives (ex. Dr. K. Leitch), the differences are pretty heavily exaggerated. Canadian conservatives have generally been pro-immigration, if not as enthusiastic about it as some of their colleagues further to the left. The debate is generally about relatively minor differences in immigration levels, or about the proportion of economic class immigrants relative to family reunification class. It's a big part of what made Canadian politics so relatively moderate, the so-called ""Laurentian consensus"". 

&gt;Is giving billions of dollars to foreign companies while cutting millions from public systems, “valuing the society we have”?

You won't find many conservatives who actually support that. Just like you won't find many liberals who support it. It's something that governments of all stripes do though, one of the exigencies of government. I mean, you're on this subreddit. Surely you've seen the posts from disaffected conservatives. Unless you're referring to their different takes on tax policy, anyway, but that's another place where the parties aren't as far apart as we like to pretend, and a whole different conversation.

&gt;Modern conservatism offers no ideas worth exploring

For just one example, modern conservatism gave us the TFSA, the single greatest retirement savings vehicle of our generation. 

For another, income splitting for couples with children was a move that recognized, if to a limited degree, that we have different kinds of economic units in tax policy, and it makes sense to treat them differently (ex. Two working couples, both with young children. All four work full time, but couple 1 is a mechanic making $80k, and a cashier making $20k, and couple 2 is made up of two municipal civil servants, both pulling $50k. Couple A pays significantly more in income taxes than couple B. How much sense does that make?).

&gt;is actively tearing down that which we as Canadians value

Have you considered that reducing costs makes them more sustainable in the long run, when the boomers are all in the old folks home drawing benefits that were only affordable when they were introduced because the ratio of workers to beneficiaries was considerably higher than it will be? There are absolutely good ways and bad ways to go about it, and they've chosen bad ways more often than I'd like to admit, but that's a question of competence, not motives, and the impulse underlying it isn't necessarily incorrect.",fmdqdau,t3_fu842b,1585974764,1585999964.0,/r/alberta/comments/fu842b/school_boards_disagree_with_kenney_about_layoffs/fmdqdau/,2020-04-04 04:32:44,2020-04

4462,iLoufah,ontario,"Let's just talk about good tenants and assume 99% of them are. Ontario has very strong support for renters, rent control, eviction protection, so I don't actually know what you mean by disadvantaged. 

I don't think renters are to blame, the issue here is how misallgined the city is with housing and rental properties. 

---------

We bought the house in 2017, mortgage payments and maintenance of property minus rental income leaves us with a net loss of ~100 per month (not to mention the 20% downpayment for the house initially) I don't know what unimaginable rewards you're talking about. 

Their aren't many people who are at the stage where they just make rental income and don't have a mortgage. And if they are, it's because they had no significant profit (or losses in our case) for atleast a decade. Do you know any other investment that takes decades to kick in? 

This is why it's a very good retirement plan, you maintain a house while living off your own job/business and after years of this, you can finally relax and retire when everything is paid off.


-----------
Here's what were dealing with and why I have an issue with the current situation. 

It was announced that evictions will not be processed for not being able to meet rent during COVID. Upstairs tenants immediately sent that to us and said he won't be paying this month's rent or leaving as planned. Understandable. The issue here is that the other property rules did not pause and the burden falls on the landlords. 

Our downstairs tenant vacated as requested a month ago, upstairs tenant was expected to move out this April and our property was expected to be redone with up to code plumbing (it was built in the 60s with smaller ID/OD piping requirements). 

We had asked the tenant to leave since mid last year so we can start the work as drywall, flooring, heating, and hot water tank would have to be removed. They refused, said evict us, we can't leave at this time and will not (they are currently paying 20% less than market average and would not leave willingly), although they finally agreed to leave in April without an eviction notice, that changed with COVID. Understandable. 

So...what happens? While the eviction is ongoing (we are at month 8 of being rescheduled before Corona pandemic even hit), City fines us $25,000 for not having the house upto code, we now have a case to plead that we could not begin work due to the house still being rented - the city isn't even required to check ongoing cases before issuing fines. this case for pleading the fine has been pushed out for the foreseeable future. 

We have already torn up the basement and spent a couple grand to begin construction in the basement (Architect, assesments of property, permitry, first payment for beginning work of removing flooring and walls). Now work is paused due to Corona. Now we have lost basement rent since the area is inhabitable. Our upstairs tenant is still in the house,  but hey! Atleast we have the permit so we don't get fined 25k again this year. We could have prevented the fine in the first place if the city was able to process the permit on time 🤷🏽‍♂️.

How are landlords protected? Every damn issue has to be plead and fines are handed out without full consideration of ongoing circumstances. That's legal fees that could have been avoided, legal fees we will pay while doing everything the right way. I don't blame the tenants for this, I blame the shitty system integration and slow moving processes.

A properly working system would have the following results; city says the house is not up to code, we apply for permit and eviction of tenants to begin work. This should take 4-5 months, instead we were on month 8 with no eviction hearing and a fine for not taking action. This system is unbelievably broken and the burden is on landlords. 

Forming a union won't fix the problem, what power could a union even have? The landlord and tenant board sets the rules, their is no collective bargaining power since their is almost nothing we can do to demonstrate our collective will without breaking the laws.",fm83l7v,t3_ft27a1,1585842161,1585867361.0,/r/ontario/comments/ft27a1/letter_from_building_owner_in_toronto_to_tenants/fm83l7v/,2020-04-02 15:42:41,2020-04
4463,windsostrange,ontario,"&gt; My dad just had to pull half his life savings to cover his tenants

No, your family has an investment seeing a downturn, the same way that everyone is seeing investments downturn. You immediately bring class into this by suggesting that tenants have any blame, due, or involvement in this process which is affecting everybody. And you do it in a comment, ostensibly, about how this is affecting everybody!

Renters are unionizing because they are receiving fewer supports than any other class, any other industry. As your reminder, major airlines just had their rent *retroactively waived* March march until the end of the year by the Federal government. On the subject of tenants suddenly not being able to afford rent because the government told their employers to stop employing them? Trudeau offered *crickets*.

If home owners need more support in this trying time, why aren't they unionizing like tenants are? Why aren't they calling their MPs/MPPs like tenants are? Why aren't they demanding more support of the big banks which are constantly bailed out by the feds when things like this happen? Why are the renters bearing *yet another* burden here? Especially when cost of living has skyrocketed like no other time in history, while those who already own were able to sit back for two decades and reap unimaginable rewards?

Thanks for letting us teachers know about your plans, pal. I mean, we really would've appreciated being told about these things PRIOR to the press announcement. With no time to put proper plans into place, this feels rushed and just something thrown out there to the masses. 

I teach Grade 1/2. I'm fairly tech savvy and have created a Google Classroom account for myself and for my students. I've reached out to my families and have received responses back that they have access to devices and internet access. I recognize that I am very fortunate, as I have friends who teach in other boards and the areas they teach in are low socio-economic, where parents are working a few jobs to pay rent and put food on the table. Internet and devices are not the priority. As for report cards, I'm at a loss. How can I accurately report on 6 weeks of work where they haven't been in the classroom and I haven't been physically there to watch, instruct and do small group learning? 

I am very frustrated for the rest of my teacher colleagues in Ontario. We sit there, like everyone else, hearing these ""plans"" being put into place without any of our unions being consulted. It's new for many teachers to be using Google Classroom (I'm speaking to the teachers who have never used it or are close to retirement or don't feel confident being tech savvy). It's going to be a learning curve for some of them. I'm willing to help some of my colleagues and provide tech support to help them set up Google Classroom. But being a primary teacher, it's so much different than my Junior, Intermediate and Secondary counterparts. I'm going to work with what I have and try my best because I want to make my students feel secure and successful.

Yesterday, March 30th, I had to go service some of the bathtubsnthey use for the disabled residents. These have a chair that swings out and then the person is swung over the tub and lowered into it. Upon arrival, I donned myy ppe, not much, just clean overalls, nitrile gloves and a ntd mask. I was screened after entering the facility,  simple stuff. I quickly noticed the staff weren't wearing masks, not even gloves.  

The nurses and staff were huddling in groups larger than 5, some even bigger than that. With no protection at all. I was working on the first tub when the head of maintenance walked in. I asked him about the lack of ppe in the facility and he said they weren't allowed to wear masks or even gloves. I said if I cannot wear mine, find someone else to do the work. He said I should be fine as I wasn't going into the residents rooms.  He explained that they were directed that ppe such as masks and gloves was forbidden because it was easier to transfer the virus if you were wearing these items.

I understand that I am just a plumber, but this really struck me hard as they had signs on the entrance doors that was a respiratory illness currently going on at this particular facility. The signs were standard stuff except for the fact that the type of respiratory illness had several layers of masking tape, 3 to be honest so you couldnt even read what the original warning was about, nor the one after that. I asked him if they had any cases of covid19,  he quickly averted his eyes and said no.

Can anybody explain this behaviour to me? I feel I should do something about it but am unsure what to do. They are a completey profit driven private company who will often let stuff that should be addressed health wise go in favour of aesthetics.

What the final product costs, is not the only consideration. It is what it costs the tax payer. People don't have a choice in paying taxes. So at least we can make the demand for tax dollars are small as possible, then let people choose what they want to pay for.

We don't need more crown corporations and we don't need anyone else on risky (for the tax payer) DB pensions.

4492,milesfortuneteller,britishcolumbia,"Born and raised Alberta here, currently living in BC. Growing up I always thought BC had no jobs and was insanely expensive so living here was always a pipe dream. After moving abroad and surviving that I figured moving to BC wasn’t so crazy. I’m in the Okanagan now and it was insanely easy to get a job in my exact field because it’s more of a retirement area and I found employers were excited to have someone young and interested in working full time hours (lots of almost retirees here working part time hours). Obviously everyone has different experiences and circumstances but this is what both my partner, my friends and I all find.

In terms of living expenses, my rent is the same as I was paying in NW Calgary and I’m two blocks from the beach now. My car insurance went from 95$/month to 212$/month so that was significant. I would say groceries are a tiny bit more expensive and gas is much more expensive and gets up to 1.40 in the summer but down to around 1.10 sometimes in the winter. Right now it’s 0.94 mind you... but if you find a job where you might have to commute a bit make sure to factor gas prices into the cost. I would say everything else is comparable!

It is important to read the following instructions and gather the necessary information. This will help ensure that there are no delays in processing your application.

You will need to provide the following personal information:

your Social Insurance Number (SIN) - if your SIN begins with a 9, you will need to provide proof of your immigration status and work permit;

your mother's maiden name;

your mailing and residential addresses, including postal codes (if you do not have a usual place of residence, you must apply in person at your local Service Canada Centre);

your complete banking information, including branch/transit number, financial institution name and number, and your account number (as shown on your cheque or bank statement), to have your payments deposited automatically into your bank account using direct deposit;

if you are receiving or will receive a pension, you will need to provide the type of pension (e.g. CPP/QPP, insurance, retirement pension from an employer), the start date, amount, and who is paying the pension. If you do not have this information at this time, you will need to provide it to us by calling 1-800-206-7218.

You will need to provide the following employment information:


the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all employers you worked for in the last 52 weeks, as well as the dates of employment and the reasons for separation from these employers;
your detailed version of the facts if you quit or were dismissed from any job in the last 52 weeks;

if your earnings varied over the last year, you will need to provide the dates (Sunday to Saturday) and earnings for each of your highest paid weeks of insurable earnings in the last 52 weeks or since the start of your last EI claim, whichever is the shorter period. This information will be used, along with your Record(s) of Employment, to calculate your weekly EI benefit rate;


Record(s) of Employment:

If your employer(s) submits ROEs electronically to Service Canada, you do not need to request copies from your employer(s), and you do not have to provide copies to Service Canada.

If your employer issues ROEs in paper format, you must request all ROEs issued during the last 52 weeks and provide them to Service 
Canada as soon as possible after you submit your EI application. 

You must mail us your paper ROEs or drop them off in person at a Service Canada Centre.

Reactivating or terminating a previous EI claim

If you started a new claim for EI benefits within the past 52 weeks, and there are weeks still payable on that claim, it will be reactivated when you complete this application online.


If you prefer to terminate your existing claim and begin another EI claim, do not start the application at this time. To terminate a claim, you must first contact us by calling 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742). Your decision to terminate a claim is final and cannot be changed.

If your existing claim is reactivated and you have worked since the start of that claim, you may be able to establish a new claim when this claim runs out.


To establish a new claim, you must have enough insurable hours and meet the qualifying conditions.

If you start a new claim instead of reactivating your existing claim, the remaining weeks payable on the existing claim will be lost.

Before you start receiving benefits, there is a waiting period for which you will not be paid.

Note: If you require additional information to help you make the decision to reactivate or terminate an existing claim, this information is only available by phone at 1-800-206-7218 (TTY: 1-800-529-3742).",fle8znx,t3_foaqf3,1585079832,1585105032.0,/r/alberta/comments/foaqf3/anyone_having_luck_reaching_ei_and_any_other/fle8znx/,2020-03-24 19:57:12,2020-03

4548,Aborik,alberta,"How is it fucked up? Nobody needs to own anything technically, to meet our basest needs we need to be provided with food and water, everything else is a luxury.

Some people choose to spend their money on travel/cars/experiences. Others choose to spend it on stocks, yet others on buying real estate, where is the crime?

Property ownership is the basis of our whole society, its what gives us independence from the state. People don't take care of shit that isn't their own/aren't paid to take care of. How do you suggest we would deal with people moving in and out of a place? What if someone works to buy a house then inherits another one from parents/grandparents? Seriously, there's any number of reasons you can own multiple properties, none of which are criminal.

This isn't even anti-1% stuff you're talking about, this is anti anybody who makes an upper-middle class living has different priorities than me. Over the course of a 40 year working life, a households annual income is easily between 80-100k per year (after taxes), on the low end, thats 3.2 million in gross income, without anything but labour, no side hustles (this is between 60-70k per earner, and you earn more as you get later on in your career remember).

2 properties is not out of the question for people who don't spend on other things. And especially not when you buy a property and rent it out to recoup like 50-75% of the cost while building equity. Overall if you spent 1/3rd of what you made on housing during a career, that's over 1 million dollars. Suppose your primary property is 700k (including interest) then your secondary property could be 600k (including interest) and you're still far below the 1/3rd figure. Ofc, you must include some for renovations, property taxes etc. but I left fairly wide margins for a reason.

Owning multiple properties is totally attainable if you make it a priority, and a couple could be perfectly middle class (work for a living) while doing so, and its not a bad way of trying to save money/get a nest egg for retirement. Mind you, the median household income in Canada for families under 65 is over 90k, so what I'm describing is not some pipedream. In Alberta: its 98k, which pushes the figure from 3.2 mil to nearly 4 mil.

Of course, this will likely get downvoted to hell just like the last time I dared open my mouth on this communist sub :) - sincerely, still an NDP voter.",fldmxox,t3_fno49g,1585067742,1585092942.0,/r/alberta/comments/fno49g/landlord_evicted_me_today/fldmxox/,2020-03-24 16:35:42,2020-03
4549,deuceawesome,ontario,"Oh yeah. There was a reported outbreak at a retirement home, with ""3"" cases. So on the weekend this letter from a doctor was going around facebook. Then the local paper picked it up on Monday. As you said, there are a lot of retirees in the area and they need to be careful as hell for the next few weeks. My mother in law works at a nursing home and is shitting bricks right now. This won't end well.

&gt;I wanted to let you know what I have learned about COVID-19 in our community in the last 12 hours.

&gt;An outbreak has occurred at Pinecrest Nursing Home and residents likely contracted the virus around March 9, 2020. Public health has indicated that there are 3 confirmed cases.

&gt;What they haven't revealed is that there are 20 other residents and eight staff at the nursing home that have symptoms, but have not been tested. This additional 28 people undoubtedly are further cases of COVID-19.

&gt;This means that there could be hundreds of cases in the community that have gone undetected. This virus is not ""just the flu."" It is much worse. It is more contagious and makes patients much sicker. News reports of the number of people who have contracted the virus are way off. We likely already have thousands of cases in Ontario that have been undetected. As the number of cases double every five days, we could easily have thousands of deaths in the next few months in our area, if we don't take this seriously. COVID-19 has the ability to make everyone very sick.

4557,xDrella,alberta,"Yeah, except if farmers get sick. They are often self employed/self business. So they don’t get sick days. They don’t get EI, they often have a hard time accessing pensions (if they pay into it which many do) if they continue to live on a farm after retirement. Our farmers are under respected in this society, under utilized, and under supported. It’s a very high risk job with volatile markets and unpredictability (droughts, too much rain- as in Alberta last year, illness, accidents, millions of dollars of machinery that can break, ect). 
It’s harder for them to get to stores that are closed earlier (or that have closed entirely) for farm equipment and supplies. Getting gas to their farms to fill their tidy tanks (despite the low fuel prices) is also becoming harder as well as getting animals to market. Hiring local hands will be harder too as more of the population becomes ill. 
I think what they are trying to do is to ensure that the farmers have the capital they need this year to deal with limited support, barriers to sale, and difficulty with sourcing equipment and parts that will be expected to come. As well as the money they need to support themselves, their families, and their workers (and neighbours) should someone fall ill. There are very narrow windows for action in farming (planting, cutting, raking, bailing) to actually turn a profit every year. So if someone gets sick, that can really mess with plans. If a neighbour gets sick, a farmer will often step in and help them. 
We need our farmers within Canada. Shipping goods in is becoming more difficult and will be much more expensive. By helping to jumpstart farmers, this money will provide them insurance that their extra labour in this coming season will not be full of risks with volatile markets. It will also help them provide feed to their animals when more grains and crops are being asked to supply the market.

Employee contributions to their pensions starting at 4%, and transitioning to 8% within a couple years.

Those who chose to switch to the DC plan will be eligible for early retirement allowance.

Raises at 2.5% first year, 2.75% second year, 3% third year, and 3.5% fourth year.

Mediator accepted a proposal made by the employer to eliminate language in the agreement and recommended a clause around minimum staffing be eliminated, creating savings for FCL.

$100k makes you poor and significantly below average where I live - that’s who lives in the small houses. I know a lot of people whose household income is $250k+ a year - they’re the ones living comfortably.

4567,it__hurts__when__IP,alberta,"Yeah not having a union is the worst. We don't get benefits, or retirement (which is why so many doctors work until they literally can't anymore). 

We also don't have protection on work hours (which is why staff and mostly residents are forced to be ""on call"" 24 hours in a day, and sometimes still report for regular duties the next day. Imagine how many errors occur because of this.

Hint: we don't study these things... because of a few reasons but mostly because it's favorable to the government.

 It's better to have people work 24 hours straight than two people for 12 hours each, or it's easier to pay residents a flat rate for the year with really crap stipends ($50-$200) for call (for example residents get about for a 24 hour call shift, which if you do the math is at best $8/hr to work as a physican in the hospital). That's slave labor if you ask me.

4568,flyingflail,alberta,"&gt;I was responding to oil prices about  crude. The difference is monumental because they are different companies in the fossil fuel industry. Their prices are intertwined, but the extraction and ability to hedge is completely different.

What? This sentence literally doesn't even make sense. Shale oil companies produce crude oil. There's no difference. There's different blends of crude oil, and shale oil is on the light side, but like I said the vast majority of US production is shale oil today.

&gt; if you don’t understand what debt obligations are then why are you making an argument that I was talking about? 

Very aware what a debt obligation is. No idea what 'infrastructure for debt obligations' means. It's literally nonsense that doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Energy infrastructure and budgets run on gas being a certain price. You  saying “it depends on who you are” is like saying it super-high interest  rates are good for people because it will help them save: if it ruins  the economy, it isn’t helping you, even if you’re saving. 

This doesn't make any sense either. What do you mean budgets run on being gas at certain prices? Countries said budgets based on different oil prices, they don't really set it on gas prices.

No, saying super high interest rates are good for people isn't at all what I'm saying. Super high interest rates are bad for investment. It's only good for those in retirement and would be a net negative for the economy. Low oil prices are not the same at all.

&gt; I never said they would be “okay” you made that up. 

What? You said they're one of the 'lucky ones'. Venezuela isn't a lucky in any conceivable world.

&gt; If you bothered to read your own article you cited, the last line clearly defines my point. 

Dunno how 'partially mitigated' proves your point when you said oil price doesn't affect Mexico's budget which is factually false, as the article said.

This virus isn't so deadly and scary all on it's own. Most people will get it and not even realize which has been evident from a lot of people interviewed in other regions of the world. It's the 2 week incubation period and during that time, is highly communicable with no apparent symptoms. One person can potentially transfer the virus to thousands over two weeks. Then all of a sudden you have 60% of your population sick at the same time. Everything shuts down. Which is what happened in China, Italy for example. Well with that many sick all at once, we don't have the resources to treat everyone equally and will need to make some tough triage choices. Who lives, who dies? This increases the mortality rate higher than it would normally be with a normal flu. Most normal flu's have a higher mortality rate under normal circumstances. But when 60% of your medical staff are also sick and you don't have the beds, ventilators, medicine to treat everyone.... This is why it is so dangerous.

Our Police, EMS, Fire and Rescue all have policies and protocols for just such a scenario. My college and University teacher wrote them years ago when multiple F3 tornadoes ripped through South Western Ontario area in the 1960s. This left emergency crews racing around the area dazed and confused not knowing who to respond to first. As they would respond to one catastrophe, several more were taking place as they tried to rescue people. Retired Inspector Doherty with the WRPS was tasked with writing those protocols for the WRPS. They have since been adopted by every single police service across the nation, parts of our military, as well as most in the USA, Mexico, and some in Europe in some form or another. It also laid out the foundations for how these services should advise our polticians during such a time. Over the years as it was put into practice, the protocols were amended, adapted, and perfected for differant types of situations. This is the first time they will be used in this type of situation here in Canada and I know full well that my teacher will be sitting in his living room in his retirement community outside of Kitchener scoffing and shaking his head at Doug Ford for not acting sooner. Our confirmed cases here in Ontario are stated at around 300 currently. The testing results are about four days behind. Social distancing was only just implimented. Where was Italy at these numbers and where were they 4-5 days from now. That's a better picture of where Ontario truly is.

Say what now? You can still buy T-Bills or a T-Bill fund, while Canada Savings Bonds stopped being sold in 2017. Also, the CPP invests in government debt for the fixed income portion of their holdings. Strangely, some of your CPP contributions are used to buy government debt, the interest of which pays out to you in your retirement, financed by the taxes being paid by the younger folks in the labour market, and corporations.

Most of our debt is held by Canadians:

&gt;From 2009-2010 to 2013-2014, the amount of the Canadian's debt held by foreign investors passed from 15% to 27% with a peak at 30% in 2012-2013. Even if growing, this level is still lower than or comparable to most G7 countries in 2013-2014 (France, 64%, Germany, 62%, United States, 48%, Italy, 33%, United Kingdom, 29%, and Japan, 8%).

4585,MagnanimousMango,ontario,"The conservatives would tell you to just go get a better job. That it is just your personal responsibility/work ethic holding you back. The fact that the economy would not function without large numbers of “unskilled” workers and jobs does not seem to register. We can’t all be earning lots of money. 

So someone working at Tim Hortons can’t make more than $14/hour because then they would have to charge $2.50 for a coffee instead of $2. Oh no. Raising the minimum wage would raise prices, but the cost would be shared by those also making much more than minimum wage. It helps level the playing field where everyone can at least live a bit more comfortably. 

What really gets me is that capital gains are taxed at half the rate as working income. So if you have money to invest you only have to pay half the tax that someone working for their pay check has to pay for the same amount of return. I get that most people cashing out investments are probably of retirement age, but it is still deeply unfair to regular workers. Oh, and if you give money to charity it’s better to be in the top tax bracket as you’ll get a bigger tax credit (33%) compared with someone giving the same amount of money who earns less (29%).

4593,454567678989,ontario,"Well we went through (and to some extent continue too).

From working, mortgage, car payment (small), and daycare to not sure how to afford some things.

Cant sell our car we are not in an area with public transport.

Cant touch or mortgage, it is already way cheaper than rent. Modest house. Moving has tens of thousands in expenses related and if you dont have funds for that your not in a good place to move. 

Cant cancel daycare or our spot is gone. The daycare has a wait list and we would not get back in. It's hard to find other daycare options, we have looked. We have two kids. My wife worked 2 weeks out of the month just to pay for daycare. I changed my working hours because in a normal month we cant afford afterschool care for our other child as well as daycare there is no room in the budget for that. If we had after school care it's the same issue with daycare for a spot. If we give it up and needed it again we would be wait listed. Add another 12.50$ a day for after school and another 11$ a day for before school care.

We have no credit debts outside this. We live modestly. No parties. No smoking or drinking. No vacations in 12 years and even that had a budget of 380$ and was in Ontario. No student loans. Well used furniture. Used kids toys. No fancy computers, cell phones etc. No cable tv. No bell phone.

EI was filed just after dec 18. Employer messed up papers and added delay. 3 weeks severance was paid for 1 week shy of 4 years of service. It gets taxed as a lump so we ended up paying more taxes in 2019 than usual. Ei folks looked at it all and told us we had to wait until april. Entitlement was 451$ a week. Nice...  and then the employer refiled the roe and claimed she was paid a retirement amount or something like that and she wasn't. We argued, didnt matter because ei couldnt figure out what thing should be coded at. Entitlement dropped to ~400$ a week and still wait until april

So now we are short 100% her income. Chewing through 1200$ a month in childcare while she non stop hunts for a replacement job. So far what was 22$/hr ... she can only find jobs at 14 and maybe 15 an hour in the city and those are part time. She had two jobs lined up but then the places didnt want to work out a shared schedule and both jobs went to other people.

Ei may be intended as a stop gap measure but many young families are running so close to pay check by pay check that there is little to no savings. When job actions hit... there is no financial cushion.

When daycare ends we will be without that 1200$ a month bill. Small car payment ends in a few months, again modest.

EI isnt enough. We dont see that our life style is over extended because there are not any cheaper options.

How would ei impact you when you are scraping by with a family and childcare?

We have been fortunate to have a modest and lean lifestyle with some savings. With no ei and low ei, the savings are gone in a few weeks.",fkse2x1,t3_fkbwby,1584488005,1584513205.0,/r/ontario/comments/fkbwby/is_there_any_compelling_reasons_why_we_cannot/fkse2x1/,2020-03-17 23:33:25,2020-03

&gt; Disparity between wages and the cost of a home, between regions with low unemployment and those with high, between what people right now are achieving and what their parents were able to before them — things like buying a home, having a child, saving for retirement.

Canadians are not doing better. So investment into Canadians is a good way for the government to deficit spend, into the economy. It is part of MMT (Modern Monetary Theory).

People view having less money as bad; without realizing your entire worth as a human is not the money you have. It is a combination of social programs; savings; money; investments etc.

If you make 100k a year and have no savings and no social programs; you are worse off then a person making 20k a year but has those social programs.

People assume during bad times they can save. You can't predict those times; and like the stock market or saving for retirement your money means fuck all.

Your money makes pennies. When you combine your money with millions of others in a retirement plan however; THEN it has leverage; THEN it has return etc etc etc.

4637,mfofic,ontario,"&gt;The 28 average was never set for elementary, this was a number for high schools. You talking Elementry numbers here. To be clear, those numbers you are providing for your school board were never put forward.

Nonetheless, the numbers I gave for class sizes from grade 1 all the way to grade 8 are still all correct, considering that is the current model in my board. And the elimination of local caps would mean that those limits of 27, 35, and 37 would no longer have to be honoured. Averages are fun to meet when they are essentially staying the same, but the outliers on the high end are important too.

&gt;You are talking about a 4 year period to be clear. The 3 years proceeding this time there were increases above inflation. About 0.68%, 0.55%, and 0.65% above each of those years. Which with compound interest would have covered inflation for about 2.5 of those 4 years. I do believe there was also a one-time payment of 0.5% somewhere in that time too, but honestly on my phone right now and don't have those exact details at my fingertips, so don't take this as a solid fact until I'm able to confirm.

We can get into the gritty mathematical number crunching of compound interest. But would the same not be true of the other 1.5 of those 4 years where teachers received 0%? Where's the mention of compound interest on 1.5 years of inflation? How does that impact your numbers?

And neither of us have mentioned this yet :

Bill 115 (fall 2012)...**""legislation that stripped education unions of their right to bargain collectively by imposing, among other things, wage and retirement gratuity freeze provisions, limitations on the ability to strike and a restructured sick leave plan. ETFO and other education unions launched a Charter challenge, which was upheld by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2016. In the challenge, the case was made that the provincial government had violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms when it enacted Bill 115.""**...the 0.5% one time payment you mention was (I believe) reparations from the supreme court for what teachers lost. But again, pennies on the dollar, and a slap on the wrist for a charter breach.

Sick days should have been compensated better, but the elimination and cutting of them I was not personally not against.  That was a ridiculously good deal that teachers had.  No one else had anything near, and most jobs still don't have anything near teachers' sick days/benefits that they have today.

ETFO teachers have already striked 5 days.  5/194 teaching days in a year (since teaching salaries are prorated throughout the entire year, even though they only teach in class for 194 of them)=2.58% of our salaries lost.  Willfully losing 2.58% to gain 2% is not greedy, it's just a matter of principle.

Under the Liberal government, the DDSB was required to cut 14 special education programs down to just 7.  The students whose needs couldn't be fit into the remaining 7 were placed back into mainstream classrooms.  Mainstream classrooms are seeing more IEPs, Behaviour Safety Plans, Autism, ADHD, ODD, classroom violence, etc as a result. Since suspensions are seldom used these days, unions have instructed teachers, EAs, ECEs, DECEs, etc to report violent incidents.

E-learning is already available. The classes are opt-in. Parents and students can choose. They are already in the driver seat. The DDSB even has a chromebook in the hands of every student from grade 7-12. Technology infused education is already here. An estimated 65,000 Ontario elementary and secondary students took at least one online course in 2017-18. The courses are developed by school boards and offered by them too. Students can even take online courses from a consortium of other boards, not just those offered by their own. Students in the Ottawa consortium for example already have access to nearly 100 online courses.
**vs**
E-learning proposed today by our government is opt-out. It will be centralized. It may even use non certified teachers. There will be a 10 fold increase in the bandwidth needs at school boards (troublesome increase that will require huge network investments) . And just wait for when masses forget to opt out and Ford/Lecce claim massive support for their new program.
*P. S. The gr 10 literacy test had a pilot in our board, to be run online, and the network literally couldn't support it. So it crashed and they had those students write the next semester.

4641,HarrysJubilee,alberta,"Sorry to hear.

I got a staph infection during an appendectomy at the exact same time Ralph Klein was enjoying a single private room for his broken ribs during the height of the cuts. When they needed to reopen my wound to clean out the bacterial gunk, the surgeon doing rounds couldn't find a scalpel on the ward and had to open my stitches by ripping at them with the tip of a sharp. I asked him if I could have a shot of Demerol before he started poking at my innards, but for some reason, he didn't have time to wait. That...was unpleasant. And I was one of the lucky--all I suffer is a painful, unsightly scar.

A month and a half prior, Ralph Klein had been re-elected on his ""He Listens; He Cares"" platform. A month prior to that election, he was busted for shredding a report on the effects of cuts to seniors programs as self-reported by seniors themselves because it didn't echo the party line that cuts to social programs = wealth for everyone. I wrote that report, as was mandated by the government to the arms' length advisory board I worked for at the time. I answered so many calls of seniors who'd worked all their lives for this province only to get kicked in the teeth during retirement when they were on fixed incomes.

All this is to say that, while I've never worked in an MLA's office, I have been on the side of tracking phone calls from the public. Make multiple calls if you can, one for each issue: raw numbers of phone calls and letters do count with conservative governments, even if only in the sense that they get scared, forcing them to lie and cover them up.

Say it costs $100 a week for food, at the end of one year, a 5% rise due to inflation would make that bill $105. No big deal right? It's just 5 more bucks, ain't no biggie.

But if that happens every year, with that 5% getting compounded, then things can get out of hand real fast.  So year 2 that $100 bill would be $110.25

Then $115.76 in year 3

Then $121.55 in year 4

Notice a trend yet? How the bill is climbing faster than just $5 a year?  And how it seems rise by a greater amount every year (5 in year one, 5.25 in year 2, 5.51 in year 3 and 5.79 in year 4)?

At that growth rate, before you know it (about 15 years) that $100 grocery bill is now $207.90 a week.

This is known as a doubling period - at 5% compound growth whatever is doing the growing doubles roughly every 15 years.  That's $100 at year 0, $200 at year 15, $400 at year 30, $800 at year 45 and so on.  Till either the system collapses or the stars explode, whichever comes first.  So given this time table - when will we hit a grocery bill that's over $1,000? Year 49, at $1,040.13 (if you started full time  work at year 0 at the ripe old age of 18, then at year 49 you would be 67 years old.  Good luck paying a $1,000 grocery bill on a pension)

So if the rise in your grocery bill climbs at 5% but your wages rise at 0%, then in 15 years you're now forced to either cut costs in other areas of your life or live on about half of what you normally eat.  At 30 years - you'll be 48 if you started work at 18 btw - you'll need to survive on a quarter of the food budget you had when you were 18 or cut even more from other parts of your life.  Then finally, when you're on the verge of retirement, you'll be forced to either an 8th of what you had or spend pretty much everything on food.  So in order to not be in poverty in your old age it's not enough to have a good paying job when you're in your 20s, you need a good paying job in your 20s with raises that can keep up with cost of living / inflation.",fjn96m4,t3_fdxmdm,1583501690,1583526890.0,/r/ontario/comments/fdxmdm/do_the_math_and_youll_see_that_teachers_are_not/fjn96m4/,2020-03-06 13:34:50,2020-03

4647,Yunan94,ontario,"&gt;Returning to the nurse example, I have read that while there is a social stigma against men entering the profession, men are actually in high demand as nurses. They are not discriminated against when they actually do seek to enter the profession. At least, not today. The gender disparity in that field is the result of the fact that men often do not want to become nurses in the first place because of the social stigma. It's still viewed as being a job for women.

This is generally true of teaching as well as other occupations feel like each gender brings something to the table in their field (deserved or not). (Except Sweden. Sweden just prefers male teachers which is an interesting case study. Places like China, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Trukey also have relatively even numbers. Other places like Italy, Russia, Lithuania, Hungary have significantly less - less than 5%). The problem is you cannot completely separate social discrimination and structural discrimination because even if you get the job  if the environment is unbearable or your credentials and/or capabilities are constantly under watch by your peers then many people choose to leave. Some may say this is a choice ""choosing to leave"" but if your choice is to stay in a hostile environment or leave I would argue it  there is a systematic element. The same reason there are many women who enter certain male dominated fields and leave.

Chapter 7 of Jim Allen's book ""Doing ""Woman's Work"": Men in Non Traditional Occupations"" has a good description throughout the book of boons and banes but this chapter has a lot of testimonial on workplace environment. Granted at the speed of academics this piece would also be considered out of date even if I do think it's still relative. 

"" Whilst the shortage of male teachers is typically researched by drawing on the perspectives of teachers, principals and students, to date no study has examined the trajectory of the teaching workforce’s gender composition. It is therefore, not known if a decline in male teachers is likely to plateau, continue, increase or reverse without intervention."" 
Mcgrath, Kevin F. and Penny Van Bergen. 2017. “Are Male Teachers Headed for Extinction? The 50-Year Decline of Male Teachers in Australia.” Economics of Education Review 60:159–67.
After shuffling though eorld trends they focus in on Australia where there has been a constant decline in male teachers by approx 20% within 30 years. Can't confirm but with that time frame it's likely after retirement they are being replaced by women.

Until someone wants to give exact number on applications vs.hired you won't ever get the number you want and since many countries prohibit having to state whether they are male or female on applications one would be guessing by names alone. Well that's not completely true a many countries also require you be registered with the school board before applying but that's probably on the line of some privacy laws if there isn't a middle step first.

4649,HugsNotDrugs_,britishcolumbia,"This is a really good question.  There are a few things going on here.

The issue is not whether the government is permitted to divert ICBC money to general provincial revenue by way of public record.  Whether they are or not is a separate issue.

The issues appear to be firstly the type of fund the money was diverted from and second whether the government is permitted to siphon money from crown corporations through secret agreements hidden from the public that are effectively a secret tax.

The type of fund the money was removed from is money for no-fault Part 7 accident benefits.  There are very strict rules prescribing what Part 7 benefits can be used for and what they cannot be used for.  For serious injuries the Part 7 benefits are already terribly inadequate.  The government further dips into this fund to make payments to itself where no such payments were permitted.  This is very different from a general transfer of revenue in that this harms those with serious injuries who should have been afforded the full Part 7 benefits as prescribed by law.  These are real tangible effects for real people.

The second issue is whether secret taxes are permitted.  Again, the issue isn't whether transfers are lawful or not, but rather whether the government needs to disclose these payments.  If ICBC is paying the government through a secret agreement when it's not obligated to do so then the question is whether this is in effect a secret tax and whether secret taxes are lawful.

Is the lawsuit an exercise of idiocy?  I can see how it might appear so but in fact it's not.

I think compensating those most seriously injured who have been provided less benefits than what is prescribed by law is legitimate.  

I also think the question of a secret tax is legitimate to keep the government honest.  If the government suddenly decided to half your retirement pension citing increased administration expenses, when in fact those expenses was just money being diverted to the government through a secret agreement, you would probably take issue with it.

In the end the courts decide whether any wrongdoing has taken place.",fjhmxov,t3_fdh3gv,1583351232,1583376432.0,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/fdh3gv/thanks_for_ripping_me_off_bc_government_icbc_hit/fjhmxov/,2020-03-04 19:47:12,2020-03
4650,GrabbinPills,ontario,"Here's a great summarizing comment I saved from /u/bittymuncher when this ag gag bill was first proposed.

&gt;For Context:

&gt;Our provincial government is trying to streamline and quietly pass [Bill 156 Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2019](https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-42/session-1/bill-156) (See [New bill aims to hide animal abuse on farms](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2019/12/05/new-bill-aims-to-hide-animal-abuse-on-farms.html) for quick read.)

&gt;Legislators are pretending that this Bill is purely about protecting farmers from animal activists that break into farms or otherwise trespass, with an emphasis on biosecurity risks, but  there is much ***much*** more hidden in the Bill.  


&gt;While trespassing is certainly a valid concern on farms, especially given the bio security risks caused by trespassers, it is already illegal, and the broad language of the proposed act could result in far more troubling effects. 

&gt;For instance, s. 4(6) would **criminalize perfectly safe undercover investigations**. Meaning, someone who enters a facility as a employee, while following every single safety precaution, who discovers evidence of abuse, could be subject to criminal charges and a massive fine. If this bill is really about protecting the animals, with an emphasis made by legislators on bio-security, why would this be illegal?

&gt;Section 13(2) also puts certain onuses on the person who gathered evidence of animal abuse to prove that they did not commit an offence. Meaning, a **regular employee** who had no intention of ""investigating"" but **who sees abuse and decides to report it**, would have to prove they were a regular employee and not an investigator. This is so backwards and will discourage employees from speaking up about abuses they witness.

&gt;Imagine if this law prohibited ""trespassing"" on retirement/old age homes, and employees or undercover employees who gathered evidence of abuse against the residents would be subjected to criminal charges and a massive fine unless they prove they didn't intend to be investigators. Would you be okay with that?  

&gt;This is a a clear example of an ag-gag law. Those interested can start their research here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag).

&gt;If the true intention of this law is to protect farmers from trespassers, which of course is already illegal, this could be done by increasing trespassing fines on farms, without limiting completely safe methods of uncovering abuse.

&gt;Camille Labchuck is a well-known animal rights lawyer and activist in the province, and was not allowed in to watch the debate. Camille was able to access the debate eventually, but only due to her personal connections (she phoned someone on the inside, who granted her access).

&gt;If you are similarly concerned, please contact your local [MPPs](https://www.ola.org/en/members/current) implore them to advocate for less problematic ways of protecting farmers.",fjh2579,t3_fdf6u8,1583339783,1583364983.0,/r/ontario/comments/fdf6u8/new_law_will_hide_animal_abuse_and_stifle_freedom/fjh2579/,2020-03-04 16:36:23,2020-03

This creates efficiency in two ways, it eliminates the unnecessary positions, and it staffs chronically understaffed agencies.

Bonus:  

&gt; Ontario teachers and other school board employees have been taking more sick days since they stopped being able to bank that time, the province’s auditor reported Wednesday.

&gt;The beginning of that five-year period is when the province stopped letting teachers bank sick days. Before that, teachers were allowed 20 paid sick days a year and could carry them forward, getting paid out upon retirement for up to 200 unused days.

&gt;The problem with foriegn investment in regards to environmental groups is when you look at the motive. American Oil companies funding environmental groups working in Canada isn't for the benefit of the environment, it's to stifle growth of Canadian Oil so that American oil is more lucrative. It'd be a different story if it was a foriegn environmental group not tied to their own countries oil investments, funding environmental initiatives in our country, at least the motive would be genuine.

Our oil is the dirtiest of the dirty... yes its 27% cleaner then 20 years ago.. but that puts it slightly on par with the average american dirtyness (WHich compared to shale or average american conventional excluding califirnia is pretty bad) 

&gt;You must understand the irony of a group of people (who I agree are doing what they think is right, atleast at the lower level of people involved as they believe in championing what's right for the environment) taking funding from one oil industry, to protest another.

Forcing people to not work isn't going to solve anything. Despite those old people still working, they are making the government revenue. You can't force companies to make those kinds of changes, eventually those people will have to quit working. Unless they lowered retirement ages (which will never happen in a million years) we are going to continue to see old people working till they die. Especially if our unions force their members to work till they're 65. 31 more years in the trades and I'll be walking with crutches.

I'm a union journeyman and this last week I was working with some guys that have 15 years experience (40/55/65) and they make me look like an apprentice with not only how hard they work but how sharp they are, and despite them taking up decent job positions for new generations, I want to work with them for as long as possible to learn what I can from them. 

What we need is a government that's not trying to emulate the Trump Administration without any bargaining chips, we have literally nothing to hold the rest of the country hostage for, since we are the victim being held hostage in our own country. The UCP is going to kill our social services, education, and then jobs. 

""Right to Work"" is in their campaign platform and with how absolutely horrible they are with keeping existing contracts with government employments, unions of all kinds should be scared of a government like this that doesn't even have the brains to release correct statistics of their own government. Albertans make the highest wage in the trades in all of Canada and almost all of the United States, and Kenney wants to change that.

4664,munkymu,alberta,"So here's two problems.

The first is that this budget shortfall has come after a literal decade of budget shortfalls. The first round of cuts started in the early 2010s, and the NDP government didn't give out any significant raises.  So yeah, the U of A absorbed the first budget shortfall.  And the next one.  And the one after that.  But this is like the 8th or 9th budget shortfall.  Of the people I worked with back in 2010, a bare handful are left and it's not just the best people, because those got work in Silicon Valley or in industry and got out.  The ones who are left are either close to retirement, have significant investment in Edmonton and their job, or are too incompetent to get work elsewhere and have been willing to accept whatever pay cut they've been handed.

Whatever dead wood is there, it's there either because they can't get rid of it (for various reasons), or because they can't afford to replace it with healthy wood.

The second thing is that a lot of the programs you might think are useless survive because they provide useful service courses.  Like... you might think that philosophy is useless because there is no call for professional philosophers.  However a ton of ""useful"" degree programs like law, computing science, engineering and such use philosophy courses because things like logic, ethics, rhetoric and such are used in multiple disciplines.  So instead of every department hiring their own ethics professor, they cooperate with philosophy's ethics professor to create courses useful for their own degree program.  Fine Arts isn't just abstract painters, it has an industrial design program and partners with other faculties for game design courses.  

In the case where a program really has very little use, it has next to no budget and three professors with a handful of grad students who occupy some asbestos-filled hole that nobody else on campus wants.  They don't have phones, use campus-wide services for everything, and probably have to hold a perogy sale to be able to afford to go to a conference once every four years.

A bunch of people seem to think that if you can't see an immediate use for something that it must then not have a use.  Like the arts.  Why spend money on the arts when they don't lead to a $100,000 per year tech job?  Except that the arts help drive the tourism industry and the entertainment industry.  When people come to Alberta from elsewhere they want to experience something they don't have at home.  Even if they come here to hike in the mountains or for business, at the end of the day they still likely want to spend money on something unique and local they can show off or talk about.  Putting money into the arts is putting money into tourism.  Putting money into the humanities is putting it into communication, PR, law, social work, etc.  STEM is very obviously valuable but even that's getting cuts.

Anyway.  The U of A isn't some fat-laden piece of pork due for a trim.  Even when I worked there, which I haven't for nearly a decade, we worked a bunch of overtime we weren't paid for and everybody had literally months of vacation banked because there was hardly any time to take it.  And it's only gotten worse since then.  I just attended yet another dinner for a former coworker who got laid off.  That team used to serve one department, now they serve an entire faculty and they're still losing people.  And it's a STEM faculty too.   
Pretty soon a world-class institution which has spun off numerous businesses and innovation for Alberta will be a total wreck.  And for what?  A tax cut to an industry that's slowly declining.  It's stupid and short sighted.",fj6x479,t3_fbdiuv,1583082014,1583107214.0,/r/alberta/comments/fbdiuv/11_cut_to_u_of_a_operating_grant_this_year_theres/fj6x479/,2020-03-01 17:00:14,2020-03

4666,it__hurts__when__IP,alberta,"The problem with using gross salary is that it's not accurate representation of take home. Physicians get no benefits ( no dental, disability, life insurance, retirement, etc) and have to pay 30-50% of their salary to overhead (nurses, office assistants, expensive equipment they use, maintenance, computers, etc). And those costs and salaries are higher in Alberta than the rest of Canada. The AMA has a lot more on this on their Twitter and official pages.",fj3556v,t3_f7ywg2,1582967774,1582992974.0,/r/alberta/comments/f7ywg2/is_alberta_going_to_be_ok/fj3556v/,2020-02-29 09:16:14,2020-02
4667,it__hurts__when__IP,alberta,"So it's not about gross salary, it's about costs. Remember that physicians get gross salary and NO benefits (0, none, Nada), aka no dental, no retirement, no vacation, no disability or life insurance etc. Everything is paid on their own dime. Also, when working, physicians pay overhead, for all the equipment they use, the tools the disposable stuff they throw away on a daily basis, gloves, tongue depressors, cleaning supplies, paying their nurses full salary, their office assistants, internet, phone, rent, computers, you name it. And overhead in Alberta is higher than anywhere else in the province, so that gross salary physicians make that's ""more than other provinces"" doesn't account for the fact that our staff and costs are also substantially more than other provinces. Our take home is similar to other provinces at present. We in Alberta have one benefit over other provinces, and that is that we have time modifiers for complex patients, so we can bill a bit extra (like 0.5 the cost of seeing a new patient) if we go over time, which allows us to spend more time and not kick out patients after one issue. However our government and their holiness are eliminating the first time modifier thereby making it unfeasible to continue to see patients for longer and so push for 10 minute medicine like they do in other provinces. 

You say doctors won't leave? I'm from Quebec, and I left there to come to Alberta where the healthcare was vastly superior for numerous reasons. Many of those reasons are about to change, and as someone with no attachments to here I am seriously considering moving elsewhere since if I'm not going to be respected by the government and allowed to practice honest holistic medicine here I'd rather do it somewhere I've got friends and family. Don't forget that many Calgarians for example are ex-pats from other cities. From my program in Family Medicine, I can tell you with certainty that more than half the program is not from Alberta, so if you think they will all stay, you're in a bubble. 

Already physicians in Canmore and some up north have been shutting down their practices and moving elsewhere. Look it up, there are numerous articles about this already. Quebec introduced a PREM system which forces physicians to work where the government tells them to, in hopes to serve underserved areas. Instead this led to an exodus and deterrent to physicians, mostly because urban trained Family doctors (like myself) are not trained for a rural setting. It would be like a dentist doing orthodontic procedures without any training. Well the UCP is trying to introduce the same system in 2022 here. While Quebec still continues with this horrid program, NFL and (I forget if it was Nova Scotia or New Brunswick) already tried it and it failed. 

The UCP is blaming doctors, nurses, teachers and other public servants and cutting their services in favour of a dying field of oil and gas and privatization. If you like your healthcare now, I would be very worried about the future of Alberta. Oh and if they even talk about separating in any serious tone, all the professionals and businesses will leave in a heartbeat.

Is everyone on OW deserving, probably not but there is a lot of people who genuinely need help because they are incapable. 

I'm a tradesperson who has worked in factories, I can tell you it's CHEAP skilled labour that's the issue for them. The place I quit before I started working for a small company had high turnover, low wages, mandatory overtime, no benefits and wanted to pay me just over 20 dollars an hour as skilled labour. I have two friends who work in factories still as unskilled labour for less and work rotating shifts which turns them into zombies most of the time. One of my former bosses was actually in an article like this saying nobody wants to work, when the truth is why would someone give their lives to these jobs to still end up in debt with no assets or retirement savings when they can not work and have their time for themselves. I don't blame them one bit. Make working 40+ hours allow people to afford their basic necessities and maybe people who are disabled or just that unintelligent to actually become skilled labour would stay in the workforce. 

God I'm tired of big businesses crying about how unskilled their workforce is but doing nothing to retain employees and refusing to pay to train them. Even in trades everyone wants you to already have 2 years experience. If you're against that kind of socialism for poor people are you pissed at all about Ontario paying 14billion to train the multi billion dollar automobile industries workforce for them? Especially an industry that usually picks up and walks away as soon as cheaper labour becomes available elsewhere or our government stops subsidizing their productions so people have jobs. Business want to own people like equipment but don't want to pay anything to maintain them. They want to use em up and then leave them to the government to take care of when they aren't useful anymore. Now you have businessmen taking over the government and privatizing these services that are supposed drains and handing them off to private institutes like welfare in peel and Niagara. If these are such big drains why would businesses be investing in them? If these things can't even run in a non profit situation controlled by ""businessmen first and elected officials second"" why would a private company run by businessmen who need to turn a profit even be possible. Its basically a self admission to be to inept to make a profitable thing profitable or it's a scam.

4705,PrecisionHat,ontario,"&gt;That's very, very arguable. When you consider the time off that teachers get and the pensions that teachers get, teachers get paid 6 figures on average over their working life. Don't forget, the average salary for a teacher in ontario is $83,500. In addition to that, you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but teachers get a pension that amounts to 70% of the average of their final 5 year's salary, and the average payout length for a teacher who worked only 26 years is 32 years. That pension allows teachers to retire at 55 without penalty and is inflation safe whereas the average retirement age of the worker in the private sector for those who actually do retire is closer to 68. So, just doing a simple calculation ignoring the time value of money, if a teacher works 26 years and retires at 58 making 83,500, their pension pays them $58,450. The average canadian lives to 82, so that's 24 years of pension, which again, using a simple calculation, ends up being what? 1.4 million in pension? if that same teacher made the starting salary of $50k for 21 out of the 26 years, and made the average in the last 5 years of their career of $83,500, then that teacher would have been paid about 2.5 million over their 26 years of work.

&gt;When compared to the average canadian, who, again, retires at 68 and who earns the average of $55,000 a year, they would make a mere 1.4 million working only 26 years that the teachers work. Those same workers don't have an inflation safe retirement fund. Now, granted, teachers do contribute into that retirement fund, but their contribution rate is what? 10.4% up to 55k of income, and 12% for income above that? Meanwhile, the average canadian has to save 20%-30% of their income to be able to earn a retirement, while working 10-15 years more than teachers.

&gt;You should probably double check my math, as it is 3 am here and I, not being a teacher, just came back from my 6th straight day working 17 hour days. Afterall, we don't all have have the luxury and the questionable ethical standard that is required for a person to hold hostage the interest of those they are supposed to help in order to get what we want.

You are very good at repeating points that don't even matter.  The average Canadian doesn't have 6+ years of post sec education.  All this amounts to is you saying  teachers have a good gig, which I never disagreed with.  I disagree with comparing education to other professions that are not comparable.  It's jealousy and/or a race to the bottom mentality.  Furthermore, as I already pointed out, you have no evidence to suggest teachers dont work hard for every penny of their salary.  You want the opposite to be true, but it's not. 

&gt;Sure. but they aren't the ones that called the strike. there is blame on the government's side, no doubt, but the underlying fact is that teachers are more than adequately funded for their services. We aren't talking about folks who are worked to the bone in mine shafts and being paid a quarter a day here, we are talking about people who, as a group, are in the top echelon of earnings in our society, earnings which are being paid for by the taxpayer. And in this day and age, the education that the teachers are providing isn't even allowing those same average taxpayers (when they become adults) to be able to afford homes to live in. That's not the teacher's fault, I'm not saying it is, but when you are demanding an increase in funding, you are inevitably demanding some form of increase in taxes. And yeah, I fight and argue just as hard when governments propose tax hikes, especially considering that I know first hand about the inefficiency of the provincial and federal government.

The government has negotiated in bad faith from the start.  Even before the contention, Ford was villifying teachers, getting ready for the war of perception he always planned on starting.  Leece lies openly and frequently about the bargaining process, knowing uninformed people like yourself who have a chip on their shoulders against unions will jump on the hate train. He doesn't even come to the negotiations and his reps were given zero mandate to bargain on ANY of the issues addressed by the union. 

Teachers are not saying ""give me what I want or I'll get your kids education"".  They are saying ""bargain in good faith or we will withdraw our service in the name of protecting the system which is largely responsible for Canada's rank of 6 in global education outcomes"".  This is about sacrificing now so that all kids aren't disadvantaged in the future. 

Non profits run surplus all the time, and it's always considered a good thing, a reason for the corporation to celebrate.  It doesnt show mismanagement in any way.  Markets can be hard to predict.

\&gt; And let's not compare these strikes to a surgeon walking out during an operation. 5 days notice has to be given before a strike day, and it's not life and death (which is what basically qualifies a profession as an essential service). 

That's a fair point. 

\&gt; They are as responsible for this being drawn out as anyone 

Sure. but they aren't the ones that called the strike. there is blame on the government's side, no doubt, but the underlying fact is that teachers are more than adequately funded for their services.

\&gt; How so? 

How so what? How are teachers holding children's education hostage? By striking, which basically says ""give me what I want or I'll hurt your kids education"".

\&gt; That profit is used to strengthen the organization (like a business reinvesting in itself). 

That's not profit, that's the use of contributions. The difference between excess of revenue (or contributions in the case of NFP's) over expenses (or expenditures in NFP's) in for profit vs nfp's is that in for profit  businesses, profit is AFTER TAX. In other words, the corporations pay tax, then they spend the money in whatever way they see fit, whether it's reinvestment in capital, employees, or increasing budgets for operations. In an NFP, their bottom line is supposed to be zero (that is to say, that the NFP is not supposed to run surpluses or deficits), as a result, NFP's don't pay any tax. The teacher's union has been running surpluses indicating incompetence (mostly in budgeting in the case of the union) and misuse of contributions. 

Look, the fact of the matter is this. When your entire sector is publicly funded, you can expect the people funding it to demand efficiency of those funds, and I don't see efficiency.

In return, they get a pension plan which pays them 70% of the average of the final 5 pre-retirement income.

The plan also allows teachers to retire at 55 without penalty, meanwhile, the average retirement age in ontario is 68. Come on now. It's a gold plated pension funded more by the taxpayer then the teachers.

Yep teachers have good pensions.  Better than the average Canadian.  But do those average Canadians have the same education and responsibilities?  Sounds like you are just jealous of a benefit of another profession.

&gt;Really, how many people out there remember what factoring is, much less what the quadratic formula is.

Because there can't be more to education than formulas.  Way to reduce psychopedagogy to a few facts and figures.

So do most people who work in professions that end up in them earning those kinds of salaries. You think nurses don't work long hours? or lawyers? or accountants? or doctors? The difference is, people in those professions don't get the amount of time off that teachers get. 

\&gt; So, it sounds like it’s about on par with what your expectations are. 

Except that most of the other professions don't get the time off that teachers get. Most of the other professions don't get the pensions that teachers get. It's not on par with reality, at all. 

The fact of the matter is this, when you look at and compare numbers, you have to normalize them. If I am comparing a guy making 2k a month, and working 160 hours, to a guy making 1k a month and working 80 hours, I have to normalize them in order for the comparison to have any sort of meaning. Yes, at the end of the day the guy making 1k is only getting 1k, but he is also getting 80 hours off. In the case of teachers, they get significant time off which other professions don't get, therefore you can't compare the stated salaries. I didn't even normalize for the pensions that teachers are guarenteed and the age that teachers are able to receive those pensions. Teachers can retire without penalty to their pension at what? 55? For most other professions, if retirement is even possible, it happens in their mid to late 60's.

The plan also allows teachers to retire at 55 without penalty, meanwhile, the average retirement age in ontario is 68. Come on now. It's a gold plated pension funded more by the taxpayer then the teachers.

Fair enough.

Really, how many people out there remember what factoring is, much less what the quadratic formula is. 

\&gt; I don't have a factual way to debunk this idea which is based on pure bias and jealousy, so you will have to settle for a big STFU. 

Why would I be biased or jealous? I'm just a guy who's been driving into toronto for the last 10 years, and every year i see a bunch of teachers striking. I'm also the guy that does the teacher's tax return, that reads auditor's general reports regarding various funding to various programs, including education. I'm the guy that has assisted in financial audits of the teacher's union. I make more money then the average teacher makes, but I've never hid children and used kids to strong-arm the public into paying me my salary. I earn my salary.

Ideally I’d open a nursing home but it’s super expensive,fi95wo5,t3_f74xmq,1582256349,1582281549.0,/r/newfoundland/comments/f74xmq/opening_a_business/fi95wo5/,2020-02-21 03:39:09,2020-02
4720,newfoundslander,newfoundland,"&gt;Those amount to about 15% of gross, and given the generous assumptions I used it doesn't change the conclusion at all.

I can't say I agree; my payroll taxes *alone* work out to about 1/4 of my employees' salaries, and that doesn't include things like cpp, ei, etc. This shit is *expensive,* and one of my major expenditures.

&gt;Now all the min wage people make 30% more. That's great for the economy. And if they are buying something the wages are a much lower % of sales than the example above so the prices are going up a lot less.

Again, i cannot say that I agree. Not even getting into inflation, the rise in the cost of services alone will eat up a substantial proportion of that 30% raise. And that money has to come from somewhere, which is what a lot of people don't seem to understand. I'm a small business owner. I pay my staff more than minimum wage because (firstly) they are *worth* it, and also because the market dictates that if I want good staff I have to pay good value for the work they are doing. The government didn't force me to do that, that . was my choice. I also offer generous vacation, paid sick time, and other benefits. *I do not have to do any of this*, but I do because i believe my employees deserve it.

But i am not by any means wealthy. Taxes fuck me every single year, and I'm barely saving anything for retirement. I'll probably have to work until after i'm 70. I live in a modest home and drive a modest vehicle. I can't afford vacations, or even many upgrades on my home. I'm frugal with my money and i don't buy fancy things. But at the end of the year, i'm barely breaking even.

I'm lucky that I'm able to offer my employees more, but many are struggling and small raises in wages can mean the differences between them staying afloat and going under. Or, putting in 80+ hours per week and making less than minimum wage themselves, ad also never being able to retire from all their hard work. And that work *should* be valued just as much as the work done by their employees working (often much less complicated, with less responsibility) minimum wage positions.

Don't get me wrong, there are people who have it worse, but when I hear people claiming that I'm the monopoly man and saying 'if you can't afford to pay more you shouldn't be in business', I get rightfully angry. I would *never* say to someone on minimum wage 'tough luck bro, if you can't hack it find another job' - because that's what an *asshole* would say.

Half of the public servants in the province will be monetarily far better off than I will be and will likely retire far earlier with a generous pension plan.

Again, these are differences of opinion, and I'm not saying I'm right on anything, but it's pretty sad to see so many comments of the comments on here offering differing perspectives downvoted to oblivion because of a 'fuck the rich' mentality.

That being said, if costco can afford to pay its employees well, so can walmart.

4724,nuke6969,ontario,"You have some pretty flawed thinking. Yes there’s an increase each year up to 10years. But teachers work 30yrs to reach max pension and be able to retire without penalty (it is considered early retirement at 30yrs. You can work another 10 to get the actual true max pension) 

So what you’re alluding to is that you think once teachers max out after 10 years they should never get a raise again? Does that really make sense to you? Plus 2% isn’t a raise it barely meets standard of living increase. Anything less than 2% is actually a rollback.  

I work for a large insurance/financial company in Ontario and have worked there 21yrs. My spouse is a teacher who has worked in Ontario for 19yrs. The amount of vacation time I get is very standard and not on the high end for my position and years of experience.  I should also note I do not have a degree in business at all. I have a four year Bachelor of Arts with honours degree. 

If that is unheard of in your line of work maybe instead of trying to drag others down to your level you should be fighting to bring it up for everyone. 

Not to mention that the teachers will cave on the extra 1% if the govt gives in on working conditions and cuts.   Teachers have already lost more in wages this strike then they will make up in the 1% increase. So why are you making it all about money when the teachers clearly aren’t?  Sounds like typical lies coming from the PC camp to me.

My father in law worked for the airlines for decades. His retirement package is a contract which promised him, among other things, the ""con"" benefit in perpetuity -- he can fly for free. He earned that benefit through thirty years of work, choosing that job over others which may have paid more because he wanted those perks. Then when the airline restructured, he (or rather, his union) negotiated retirement packages that included continuning that benefit and continuing to accrue seniority for priority placement.

Without talking about the other changes to the pension that means an immediately 11% pay deduction as they receive 11% less from the company towards their retirement and instead see that taken out of their take-home pay.

The second part is the 6.5% savings plan the company wants to axe. They've stated it would be replaced by some form of ""Performance Bonus"" but at this point that is entirely vague with no numbers attached to it. Negotiations haven't made it far enough for them to outline what exactly that Bonus would entail, how much it would be worth, what are the stipulations etc.

4749,SteveBeck1,saskatchewan,"Sounds like the same thing, fcl is aggressively going after the union. Its just your wording of it, makes it sound like a threat or intimidation to people who support the union. Give up now or you'll lose your job.

The worst part of that strike is how the workers were treated and covered in the media. It also shows what kind of tactics company's are willing to use to hurt employees.

After that strike irving oil went after all the unions in its set of company's. This is basically FCL's playbook.

Here is some quotes from the article 5cent quoted.

\-""The language the media use to address workplace disputes is generally biased against workers. Job action is almost universally referred to as a ""strike"" even if it is, in fact, a ""lockout""""

\-""In fact, regardless of the substantive issue, workers are almost always presented as making ""demands"" while employers make ""offers"" (Bauer, 1986; Walsh, 1988). Even when employers *demand* concessions, as is now virtually the norm, the media still refer to the employer's ""offer"" as though it is a zero-based world in which the employer is to be congratulated for offering anything more than nothing for every new contract (Knight, 1992).""

\&gt;Magistradocere those 2 Quotes should hit hard for you, As in most of your post you refer to the workers striking and making demands.

\-""often focus on the relatively high wages of the most senior of the skilled workers at the refinery. This then served as an agenda-setting technique in which the papers put wages on the table for public debate when in fact they were not *the* issue in the strike itself. ""

\&gt;Refinery Facts 101, Simple numbers that distract, but no break down.

\-""While the news stories may occasionally recite the line that the company is ""seeking greater flexibility,"" the actual debate, which is an important and complex one, is never laid out for the reader.""

\-""the media tend to focus on the *effects* of the strike, rather than the *causes* and *dimensions* of the conflict, and tend to emphasize the effects on ""innocent third parties."" Media coverage usually avoids digging too deeply into the root causes of the dispute""

""New Brunswick papers revealed the fact that some readers were under the impression that the strike was primarily about wage increases.""

\-""The papers portray the strikers as foolish in their attempts to go up against the might and power of the Irving empire.""

\-""The language in these articles emphasizes the inconveniences caused by the striking workers and presents the Irving company as the party that has to cope with a situation caused by forces outside of itself.""

\-""The papers also echoed the practice of portraying the strikers as causing disturbances and harassing the public, for example: refinery workers *harass* a ""scab""""

\-""The article provides information that documents the power of the Irving Company to prevent even small business people from hiring the striking workers to do odd jobs for extra money because these businesses fear retaliation from the Irvings in the form of lost contracts or future employment""

4752,5centrider,saskatchewan,"&gt; lots of refineries have stepped up to help FCL with replacement fuel and loaned management refinery workers.

This is the first I've seen mention of this, can I ask where you got it from?

I was reading comments this evening on a Leader Post article and here's what one posted about other refineries (I bolded some of it to make a few points:

""If you compare what coop is asking from their employees with what happened at bargaining with the rest of Canadian refineries it might help you understand better what's going on.

The refining industry isn't hurting the way the rig/extraction side is. The lower the price of oil, the more profits refineries make. Right now we are struggling in Canada with our refining capacity to keep up with demand, so all refineries are pushing production.

Those wage increases were bargained nationally for all refineries across Canada, 46 businesses in total across the energy sector..and all the other companies have happily signed without asking for concessions at all from their employees, let alone huge concessions like attacking pensions. If the carbon tax etc was such a major concern right now, don't you think at least one other refinery would've put up a fight, asked for cuts, changed pensions etc?

They usually do a 3 year contract, but this time did a 4 year contract, the other refineries were happy to sign and have a guaranteed extra year of making record profits with no potential labour issues.

The DB plan they have was a common pension in the industry, and many other plants have members on the same type of fully funded plan. They also have their plans closed to new hires, similar situation. Yes it's a good plan, yes FCL can afford the plan. Many members were going to switch off the plan to the DC plan anyways, but for others the proposals FCL is making will have huge effects for their retirement. They're not just proposing the 11% funding, they're also changing the formula for how it's calculated and removing indexing. They picked numbers so ridiculous, and refused to properly bargain knowing it would push the workers out

Would you take a 15% cut this year, and huge pension cuts when you look across your industry and see you'd be the only refining workers in Canada doing this?

**It's interesting that for all plants across Canada offering the same deal, we're the only one in the industry asking for concessions, the only refinery not taking advantage of record profits, the only plant with locked out workers. Strange considering it's a cooperative.**

**Fcl isn't fighting the workers about their pensions. Fcl is trying to break the union. This is the real issue, and this is why national came in and escalated things. Fcl has no intention of making a deal, they're just trying to bleed their employees out, hence the dramatic fight.**

**FCL began training their managers, shadowing employees in the plant in an intense way after they signed their last bargaining agreement. Fcl picked every fight at work they could over the last 2 years to tie up the union, and kept that scab camp on retainer for the last 2 years (great way to spend our profits) The workers could see what was coming. All of this was planned way before the national pattern 11% wages were negotiated. It wouldn't of mattered what the national wages were. If Banda had actually wanted to make a deal with the workers, none of this had to happen. ..""**",fhafvh7,t3_f221ln,1581408600,1581433800.0,/r/saskatchewan/comments/f221ln/is_reginas_coop_lockout_a_watershed_moment_for/fhafvh7/,2020-02-11 08:10:00,2020-02

4755,mark0fo,saskatchewan,"The older workers are on DB plans, which have indeterminate funding requirements.    Unlike younger public servants who are on DC plans, which are a lot like RRSPs, in which the worker takes the risk of how well the financial assets contained therein will perform.  

The problem with the DB plans is that, because their funding requirements are indeterminate, and fluctuate based on a formula that incorporates interest rates, the employer can be hit for some pretty severe required payments to keep the plan ""solvent"" as required by the Canadian pension regulators.  

Obviously the employer (FCL) doesn't want that indeterminate liability, so they want to wind down the DB plans for those older workers and convert them all to the same DC (RRSP-like) plans.

The problem that rises comes with the conversion between DC and DB.  The Income Tax Act only allows for a certain amount of money to be contributed to a DC/RRSP plan, over which, funds would have to be 'deregistered' and paid out, immediately taxable as income at the top income tax rate.

As a result of such, these older workers potentially face a one-time tax liabilities of $200-$300k on such payments.  In fact, for workers nearing retirement, it might actually be better to literally retire before the agreement is signed than to work even a single extra day.

Obviously the union (Unifor) doesn't want this.  So they're fighting.  And the employer (FCL)  doesn't want to support a pension plan for which they have no idea of costs as this makes the business very hard to manage.

4758,SoDatable,ontario,"Oh hey, it's me!

I get that the article is about education, but the headline kinda made me think.

When the election happened I posted in a few places that one of my fears was a repeat of the Progressive Conservative government of the mid-90s - that kids would be dealing with the same shit that poor kids in the 90's dealt with.

That, of course, came from my own experiences.

The Harris Days were a time when poverty felt like a crime. My mom withdrew because Harris threatened to open snitch lines - one wrong move, and you'd be cut from Ontario Works. Prior to her hand injuries, she was a letter carrier, a few years away from early retirement. After her hands were destroyed, he found herself relying on Ontario Works. On one occasion had a neighbor call to file complaints because, apparently, describing the fucking concept of powdered milk as ""a funny white powder"" must mean you're being fed cocaine for breakfast. That meant that we couldn't really trust our neighbours anymore, and so we became withdrawn.

It doesn't help when you have a family member who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome.

I wasn't exactly the best student, I ultimately dropped out because paying for post secondary education was not going to happen, so why bother?

We went without electricity for a summer. We also didn't have a phone for a long time, not that it would have mattered much because it's not like connecting with friends meant you could suddenly afford movie tickets or eat out (imagine being upset that the phonebooths at the end of the street were removed because some kid might want to reach out to their buddies). And as much as I loved my friends, the fucking insistence that they stalk you on your trip to the only restaurant that met your arbitrary diet needs (i.e. nowhere, so you could scarf down a helping of nothing) suddenly made outings more expensive.

Even today I've been told that people from poor families should have never existed because their ""parent() didn't have the means"" to raise us, not that she'd have known it until she had to live it. When I tell them who I was, they suddenly become keen to carve out exceptions: ""Oh, not you. Your family had it together"". Seriously, I love y'all, but **fuck you** for that.

To this day most of the food I buy has 30% off stickers. I make decent money, and maybe these habits aren't actually ""bad"", but there's a part of me that feels a sense of guilt, and I'm not entirely sure why. There are also periods of preservation-eating - where, instead of throwing food out, you eat it so you aren't throwing money away. It's not healthy, and the solution is to buy less.

I'm better at buying less now. My mom isn't though; she just tossed out a pile of seasonings and spices that were attacked by mice. By the way: the reason poor people are stereotypically messy is because they extend their dollars into seemingly inconsequential and massive amounts of stuff for teh simple reason that it's cheap. You buy boxes of soup bullion, canned food, juices, seasonings, noodles, and so on. You buy so much that you can't possibly use it before it's BB date (food is good for up to six months after it's BB date - they teach you this in Foodbanks. I ate a steak out of the freezer that was five years past its BB date once. It was delicious.)

**I apologize for the wall of text here.** I could go on, and we didn't even have it as bad as some of the families we'd meet in passing. We were actually quite well off. And some of the skills I picked up are things I still use: I don't drink milk much - I'm lactose intolerant, besides - so I use powdered milk instead.  I managed to learn enough to build a career that I'm happy with. Because of my success (and, lets face it, luck) I was able to get the help I needed to change the course of my life.

I think I'll stop now. I could go on, sharing anecdotes - some are/were fun to experience. But none of it is thanks to the politicians who believe that poordom is for born losers, and if I had the luxury of belief that the Sally-Ann offered, I'd pray that we could do more for people politically.

I wouldn't call Elliot Lake depressing, but it is definitely slow paced. It's a retirement community, and the median age of the residents is something like 57 years old, and it caters to that. So there's no movie theater, no stadium, and no mall (the mall collapsed in 2012, and the replacement is basically just a strip mall). If you're used to a big city, it's completely different. There are only 11 restaurants in the entire town, and it's almost an hour's drive to the mall in the nearest city.

So if you like shopping, or going to the museum, or the symphony, Elliot Lake is not for you. On the other hand, if you're an outdoors person, and like cycling, hiking, fishing, hunting, or skiing, it's much better for that the Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal.

The cell phone service from Bell is fine; Rogers is spotty. A local outfit called Eastlink is probably your best bet.

The entire town is barely three miles wide by three miles long. You can get around on foot, by bike (in the summer), and the buses go everywhere. On the other hand, if you want to go outside of Elliot Lake to anywhere else, a car is a must.

For example, in example 2, someone who worked 13 years has already earned a pension entitlement of $658,000, and the retirement allowance of $262,080.  

If they work for another 17 years, they will only earn an additional $460,000 in pension value.

Hence, the value of the pension earned is being cut back severely.

Also, FCL doesn't tell you that 'retirement allowances' are, for someone who doesn't have RRSP room available, immediately and fully taxable at the top rates.  So if you're the worker in ""example #3"", with 2 years left to work -- at a 42% tax rate in the year that you retire -- the CRA will take $311k in income tax on that Retirement Allowance as it has to be declared as income.

It's hardly surprising but points to a need for rational management , not expansion of poor management by people lacking proper skills or common sense.

We also lack prevention strategies. If anything we need far fewer beds and to require gov. to provide proper community services to new emigres, dental care for the homeless, psychologists for the distressed, sharp penalties against nursing homes and ER docs who admit the well, fewer ERs in cities like Torornto. psychotherapists in OHIP to prevent mental health emergencies, overnight clinics for babies and children - or at least telehealth and Skype for them and most who attend ERs.
the public is not impressed with hospitals. True they are a bit more business-like than a few years ago, but the public should not be funding this mess. People at hospitals are fuming.

The public pays for and deserves so much better. When will Ontario take a few simple needed steps to end it?

4798,mark0fo,saskatchewan,"3 or 4 years ago, long-term interest rates were considerably higher than they are today.  The calculations for pension solvency use, as one of their most significant inputs, long-term interest rates.  

Even as recently as a year or two ago, most professional economists believed that long-term interest rates would start to rise again, or at least stabilize.  Making those calculations less unfavourable to the sponsor of the pension plan.

Unfortunately a combination of poor investment returns, \*and\* the lower long-term interest rates that have actually materialized have effectively conspired to increase FCL's pension funding costs dramatically.  

Meanwhile FCL wants to convert all workers to the DC plans instead of the historic DB plans that have the funding issues.  But formulas implied by the Income Tax Act effectively would result in a commutation value and deregistration that in many cases would be $100-$200k losses to near retirees when such a conversion is made.  

So the older near-retirees....are faced with a situation that if they don't retire just before the pension changes are actually made by FCL, will lose potentially $200k in pension.  If you make $100k/year ($60k net of taxes and expenses), and you're told that you're going to take a $200k loss, and you have 2 or 3 years until retirement -- will you ever re-coup that $200k loss?  

The other big problem is that most other refineries (represented by Unifor) have similar issues with pensions.  So if FCL gets away with doing this to the Unifor members in Regina, they other refiners will do it in Edmonton, in Sarnia, in Montreal, etc.",fgofzdx,t3_ezhj2y,1580968638,1580993838.0,/r/saskatchewan/comments/ezhj2y/homes_of_refinery_managers_hit_with_paintballs/fgofzdx/,2020-02-06 05:57:18,2020-02

That ties in to your last question, finding an apprenticeship is no easy task as an apprentice is often seen as a bit of a burden for a company. I don't think the shortages have as much to do with recessions as they do with the lack of available apprenticeships.
Further I believe that the trades were not seen as a good career choice for a long time and were not pushed on graduating high schoolers in the same way a university or college education was.

Times that $50,908 by 2.8%(I did say 3% but 2.8% is more accurate as I fill out the detailed math in excel) each year up to the present time and we hit an average salary of $90,000 per year.  Why $90,000? Well, the numbers above are based solely on full-time workers.  They don't work in any part-time or not currently active teachers. The Ontario Ministry has $90,000-92,000 as their number, which I'm guessing they are basing on full-time workers to slightly inflate the number when stating to the public(I agree its garbage they aren't honest). OSSTF has $87,000 which is based on an average using union due data, which may have teachers on leave ect. used in their data to deflate their number(Which possibly isn't 100% honest either).

4827,ExplainsSocialEnigma,ontario,"&gt; How many more? 

Until shortage of teachers no longer becomes an empirically binding restriction on student outcomes.

&gt; Have you got a plan to renovate schools for 10-student classrooms? 

What have I said that makes you believe that existing classes need to be renovated to accommodate 10-person classrooms? 

&gt; We get world-beating outcomes from our current system.  

On what metrics? Our high school graduates are not particularly employable and not particularly prepared for post-secondary. The fact that we apparently have incredible skills shortages and need to import huge numbers of foreign students and foreign employees is evidence of this.

&gt; Teachers make a decent salary, but it is not out of line with what a similarly capable, qualified person makes in private industry.  

Teachers, especially elementary teachers, have a much lower workload than similarly capable and qualified people in private industry, with short days, 13(!) weeks of vacation and incredible job security, and much lower stress than most other professionals (lawyers, doctors, accountants). With those perquisites, they would need to earn much less than similarly capable qualified people for their compensation to be equitable. Further, they're paid by the public - any dollar paid to them is a dollar taken away from the public.

&gt;If you cut pay by 20%, which would be required to change classes to 18, while being revenue neutral, you will lose some current teachers, and the best and brightest of the next generation will not be interested in teaching as a career.

Since many of the best and brightest already can't get quickly into teaching, with most languishing in supply list purgatory, I don't believe the prediction. Even if you lose 50% of applicants, you'd still have more than enough grads to fill the spots. Another tool would be to delay retirement eligibility. And if it turns out that the best and brightest are leaving, *how about offering retention raises to only the best and brightest?*

&gt; Your concept seems to be something you came up with in a vacuum, and it doesn't really hd up to any scrutiny at all.

4830,izzidora,alberta,"Ok so I work with AHC a bit so Ill try to explain.

With the Senior's Benefits Program, if you were 65 and your spouse was say, 60, they would also qualify for this. It covers your prescriptions, which is very important to all Albertans, as normally this is covered by Blue Cross, which we pay out of our pockets for. A lot of seniors, or those approaching the age have a LOT of prescriptions. Yay getting older! So this was helping older couples who are possibly on a small budget as they are approaching retirement age.

Now they have decided not to cover the spouses. While I understand why, what AHC has done is send a letter out to those under 65 (which most folk don't bother reading), telling them they now have to apply for BC again. Only because most people don't read the letter, they don't find out until they go in to get their prescriptions and surprise! You now need to pay hundreds of dollars for your much-needed meds or wait a few weeks while you re-apply for BC and pay their monthly fees. Which are not cheap, my son and I pay almost $130 a month for BC.

One lady has to go through all of this hassle and extra costs, only to turn 65 next year and have to come in and re-apply for the SBP.

What they should have done (If they really needed to, which I don't agree with because its a cheap ass move and I think people over 60 should get a break from costly scrips),is to stop the program from allowing new spouses to receive SBP, instead of taking it away from people who already have it and have been budgeting for it for the last 1-4 years.",ffqdoj2,t3_euhlc1,1580131437,1580156637.0,/r/alberta/comments/euhlc1/approximately_46000_albertans_could_lose_health/ffqdoj2/,2020-01-27 13:23:57,2020-01

4834,x97mdr,NovaScotia,"Hey, today is your lucky day!  I live about a kilometer away off Old Courthouse Branch and Weston.  I'll answer your questions as best I can.  Feel free to DM if you have others.  I grew up in Pictou County but recently moved back to the area bring my kids closer to family.

- It is true that job prospects are poor.  This does depend on your skillset, of course, and YMMV.  I moved back as a remote worker out of my house.  
- For house prices, you could look up comparably appointed houses on the Multiple Listing Service ([MLS](https://realtor.ca)).  House prices are considerably cheaper than the rest of the country, especially in this area.
- Taxes are fairly high compared to other provinces.  Your property is in the County of Colchester, and you can find property tax and other information on [their web site](https://www.colchester.ca/tax-rates).  Your neighborhood is actually Valley, the Village of Bible Hill is close by though.
- There is a 15% sales tax and [here is some information on provincial taxes](https://www.novascotia.ca/finance/en/home/taxation/tax101/personalincometax/default.aspx). 
- Depending on exact siting the property is on a flood plain, but it would not be in danger every year.  It would have to be a pretty big flood to get to it.  The county might have more specifics if you were to call or email them.
- Note there is a shortage of family doctors in Nova Scotia right now.  It's one of the big downsides to living here.  
- As to basements, the water table is high around these parts, but if you're building and close to retirement consider a single level home with in-floor heating.  That is very popular around here in new builds.  Depending on where you come from in the US the cold may be a shock.  For Canada though, the Nova Scotia climate is pretty mild, owing to the ocean nearby.  Having a good, efficient heat source is important.

There are lots of positives to living in this area though.  

- Some of the warmest beaches North of the Carolinas are just a 30 to 40 min drive.  
- Halifax is an easy one hour drive away making day trips and access to an international airport convenient.  
- The pace of life is a lot slower and more enjoyable, and you won't find nicer people anywhere. 
- lots of great microbreweries, cool restaurants, and festivals to keep entertained.

4841,Arts251,saskatchewan,"This comment should help explain the situation and give some perspective to the numbers.  I'm part of a large DB pension plan that isn't wholly funded by the employer and the funding status is continuously analyzed and adjusted - when the portfolio didn't achieve it's projected investment returns it meant everybody paying into it had to adjust our contributions (this is the risk you take with a DB pension plan rather than defined contributions).

In the case of the CCRL, the DB plan has always been wholly funded by the employer,  which kind of sets a precedent that it's on them to manage the funding status, and clearly underfunding it for some time was their prerogative (they did have a choice to fund it but that would be very expensive and have business implications).  Now that the collective agreement is expired they want to change the whole basis of the funding model to be no longer funded in whole by the employer, they are trying to achieve this by 1) shifting responsibility to the employers and 2) pushing towards DC plan so they no longer have to manage risks for future liabilities.

Employees have a right to be angered by such a shift in the funding, the 11.25% is sort of moot because there is no guarantee they will receive similar future pay raises but will be stuck with a bill they never had before and risk losing retirement benefits that they would otherwise be essentially guaranteed (assuming the pension plan remains viable).

There is no real good point for either party to be striking or refusing to go to bargaining table - Union is clearly saying no change to the way the pension is funded, so then get together and negotiate how to pay that.",ffdhkwv,t3_esgoh9,1579821024,1579846224.0,/r/saskatchewan/comments/esgoh9/unifor_found_in_contempt_of_court_fined_100000/ffdhkwv/,2020-01-23 23:10:24,2020-01

They could, but it'd be a bit of a waste of their multi-year Bachelor's of Education.

It works on personal scales, when you're telling someone to find new people to hang out with if they don't mesh well with your friend group, because all them leaving means is that they might find another friend group and will stop bothering yours. The only person who could get hurt is the person you kicked out. But on industry scales, teachers leaving means we end up short on teachers. Entire generations of students suffer.

That's not a lot of vacant housing, though, because they opt to stay in their homes longer, most now never enter a retirement home or community or downsize their homes.

4882,BeTheParadigmShift,saskatchewan,"Thanks for the heads up. Thinking about this whole strike I can’t help but wonder about all those workers that were ready to retire in the next 5 years. If you were a man or woman who started working there 30 years ago it might have said in your sign on papers, retirement after XX years with your full pension, then at 65 CPP and old age security. And now that pension is ridiculously big, huge, massive. The amount of interest generated would keep your family going forever. 

There is an entire industry built around  pensions, its now not just your money. The pot is divided up and sent off into different funds and investment, which are then made up of more people’s money, private and public. And then all of that is looked after by bankers, investors and hedge fund people.  So all these extra people are going to lose money because pension contributions will be withdrawn.

We can’t have people stop working, what kind of message are we sending...

The workers are owed what they’re due, pay them the pension you promised and change what you need to change so you don’t get bit in the ass when the next group of people are ready to retire.

4884,AugustineTV,alberta,"I firmly believe there is a benefit to having unions like the United Nurses of Alberta. I support their efforts in solidarity and hope they are able to get the demands they have met.

As part of an informational effort I've written a long post with many examples of how unions benefit workers in today's time:

- We need to look no further than France, Italy, UK, Spain, etc... for examples of areas where unions fought for higher days of paid time off ([here's a chart](https://fm-static.cnbc.com/awsmedia/chart/2018/7/13/chartoftheday_15005_statutory_minimum_paid_leave_and_public_holidays_n.1534170797355.jpg?))

- In addition, in countries like Sweden, Finland, and Norway there's far more power in the hands of unions to prevent the exploitation of workers. These countries have up to 70% unionization rates.

- In fact, when Toys R Us tried expanding into Sweden they had a strict global anti-union stance. Swedish unions were against this and conducted a strike. Delivery workers stopped delivering goods, warehouse workers wouldn't handle shipments for Toys R Us, and bank employees refused to process transactions for them. 
Eventually Toys R Us caved and allowed their workers to unionize. This led to comprehensive medical benefits for the employees, more paid time off, better work hours, higher wages, and higher amounts of free training for employees (as opposed to the training being paid by the workers). [Here's an article going into this in detail](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/03/18/sweden-retail-unions_n_6888328.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL3RvZGF5aWxlYXJuZWQvY29tbWVudHMvM2NlbmxtL3RpbF90b3lzX3JfdXNfaGFzX2FfZ2xvYmFsX2FudGl1bmlvbl9hbmQv&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMFXeLN1beCipJ4j090u6ouxl6Lgl7ieF96cNpcUqeT7T9Gp2gznn9jPl_VMdSfrFX3fU3B6gIxgLt1yB_6mz0V32Zp3HJXsqYx--cRrPZ04yY7TUM7qpjoQGJtDTlQqwkke-VzmzyOmB6jCQucSYjvPdCefC8lPRQY4XGQI7_PB)

- It's been shown that the higher the rates of unionization the lower the days of strike as well. This is because when there's collaboration between multiple industries by the workers there's less of an incentive by companies to institute moves that go against the wishes of workers. This reduces the need to strike in the first place.

- Furthermore, it's been shown in many studies that ""on average, a worker covered by a union contract earns **13.2 percent more** in wages than a peer with similar education, occupation, and experience in a nonunionized workplace in the same sector."" ([source](https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/#epi-toc-9))

- Union workplaces are also safer for workers. In companies where the workers are in a union it is FAR less likely for companies to have unsafe practices that can harm them. In fact, in some places unionized workplaces have **half** the OSHA violations. This helps protect workers in places such as oilfields up north, or construction areas in Calgary. ([source](https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/#epi-toc-11))

4906,always_on_fleek,alberta,"&gt; What I’ll say is this: we should expect teachers to have wages where they can afford the median house in our communities while saving for retirement. They should be decidedly in the middle class.

What is that in Calgary or Edmonton in your opinion? 

I personally agree they should be middle class because they possess specialized training (via post secondary education). Not quite upper middle class because their training is not as specialized / complex as a pharmacist or engineer but definitely more than lower middle class. 


People want teachers to be paid moderately well but they never provide an indication of what that is. There is a strong possibility that teachers are not at this level and either higher or lower. Like every occupation wage profiles need to be re-evaluated regularly but I think the issues with teachers is that they are not and instead everything is based of what they are currently being paid. 

For example do pharmacists deserve more money as we change their job duties to include more prescriptive powers, more injections, more health plans? Does an accountant deserve less money as we introduce more automation in their job to remove the mundane - but very important - tasks?",fdxo52j,t3_en1z52,1578771144,1578796344.0,/r/alberta/comments/en1z52/alberta_arbitration_outcomes_result_in_no_wage/fdxo52j/,2020-01-11 19:32:24,2020-01

I disagree. The median person isn’t required to have 5-6 years of university education.

Right now they’re at the median for that group, but not keeping up.",fdwqzmy,t3_en1z52,1578761471,1578786671.0,/r/alberta/comments/en1z52/alberta_arbitration_outcomes_result_in_no_wage/fdwqzmy/,2020-01-11 16:51:11,2020-01

What I’ll say is this: we should expect teachers to have wages where they can afford the median house in our communities while saving for retirement. They should be decidedly in the middle class. 

That not only is a good way to help pattern wages in other careers but it is a good way to ensure we retain teachers instead of having most of our teachers be only new graduates (with the ones that stick it out being the ones with the worst outside prospects). Right now 5 years after graduating only 50% of trained teachers are still teaching. While we can debate whether it would be better to have that number lower or higher what I can tell you is that having that number way lower would be worse for teaching quality. 

A common perspective I see is that teachers and nurses are not subject to market forces - a kind of complaint that their wages shouldn’t have gone up in the boom, and that their wages can be cut or frozen without a change in retention. Assuming that market forces don’t apply to a special situation for some reason without evidence usually leads to bad outcomes and will in this situation too.",fdwi8pp,t3_en1z52,1578758899,1578784099.0,/r/alberta/comments/en1z52/alberta_arbitration_outcomes_result_in_no_wage/fdwi8pp/,2020-01-11 16:08:19,2020-01

4913,Workfh,alberta,"I should have qualified my first point that I think an APP having any investments in Alberta is too many. When your source of income is all of Alberta you already have a lot of your ""investment"" in Alberta. Similar to how I would never own stock for the company I work for, I'm already invested in the company as my pay comes from them. For CPP I'm willing to be a bit more flexible because of the variety of economic regions but they are probably over invested in Canada. Most canadian investors are also over invested in Canada. 

For the political vulnerability of the plan. I think the voting patterns historically in Alberta make it more of an issue. The threshold to actually kick a conservative party out of office is pretty damn high here so the political risk of taking money from AIMCO may actually be worth it. That's a slightly different story federally, as evidenced by the conservatives losing almost all seats after Harper messed with EI. 

On the administration side, AIMCO is the investment manager not the plan administer. For a bunch of the pension plans in Alberta that is done by APS. There are lots of parties that make these plans work and right now Alberta does not have the infrasture for an APP that would replicate CPP fully. It could happen but we need to see an actual plan. It really doesn't help that people don't know a lot about CPP and even less about CPPD let alone retirement savings.

4931,AryaLyannaOlenna,ontario,"Again with the tiresome $90,000 a year. Let me let you in on a little secret:

1 - Bachelor of Ed programs are now 2 years - so you obtain a 3 year or 4 year degree and then apply for the Bachelor of Education program, which is 2 years. That is now 5 or 6 years spent in post secondary education.

2 - Once you graduate in Ontario, it can take anywhere between 1 to 3 years to get hired on as a supply. I speak from experience - it took me a year and a half to get a supply teaching position. I had 3 part time jobs before getting hired as a supply. I also did a lot of volunteering at 3 different schools. I had almost 8 years of experience as an Educational Assistant underneath my belt and was still required to volunteer to get excellent references, just to get to the interview portion.

3 - Once hired, you begin a very long process of trying to get onto the Long Term Occasional pool. Conservative estimates from 3 to 7 years - and it is board dependent - is the time it takes to get a permanent teaching contract. Lots of time, behind the scenes prep work, teacher performance appraisals and teacher mentors to learn from. Nobody handed me anything - I earned it on my own, like so many before me. Many teachers who are supply teaching or are in the LTO pool might be paying a student loan or student line of credit off while working - or they might be paying a mortgage or bills while supplying/LTO jobs.

4 - AQ/ABQ courses - if you don't know what those are, allow me to explain. Teachers, once they graduate and get to the supply pool and make it to the LTO pool, begin the task of paying additional fees ($675 to $775) for Additional Qualifications courses or Additional Basic Qualifications courses. This is done for 3 reasons: to get their proper QECO salary grid; to specialize in certain subject areas or to apply for specialized teaching positions. I took over a dozen of them at $675 each. And teachers can claim only one AQ or ABQ course per year on taxes. Nobody forced me to take a dozen courses. I did it because I enjoy learning and a good teacher is a continual student.

5 - The salary grid. It takes 11 or 12 years to get to the absolute maximum pay. And GUESS WHAT? That $93,000 or $97,000 figure that keeps getting spewed out in the media by Lecce is NOT what the teacher takes home. Like anyone else, we get the chop off our pay through CPP, teacher's pension plan and income taxes. Imagine that.

6 - Early retirement. I got into teaching late because of the fact that when I applied to York &amp; U of Toronto, they were not - for some reason - accepting me; even though I had an A average, with years of experience in summer camps, as an EA, with excellent references, etc. Moving forward, I had to go to an American University, one that ran a Bachelor of Education program here in Ontario, but it cost me $25,000 for the 2 year program. I was also paying a mortgage at the time I went back to school full time and I made it work. It was the toughest two years, but through saving, cutting back on a lot of things and through birthday gifts and Christmas gifts from my parents, I was able to pay the mortgage and then pay the line of credit off. Early retirement nowadays - I cannot even think of early retirement. I have at least another 24 years to go. So, early retirement is not an option for me, and for a few of my colleagues who could retire right now, it's not feasible for many viable reasons (spouse/partner is ill, they have a child with special needs, they are widowed/divorced). Unless you have extremely deep pockets and no mortgage or credit card debt, I don't see a huge wave of early retirements happening.

7 - Maybe it's just me but in the summer, I work in summer camps. Every single July, I have taught summer camps, International Language camps and STEAM camps. My GOD, I actually got off ""my lazy teacher ass"" and worked an additional month. Again, nobody forced me to do so. I enjoy it. I like being employed for an extra month and enjoy teaching in different subject/grade levels to diversfy my skills. I also enjoy meeting other educators that I normally wouldn't meet during the school year. Many teachers I know also use the time off in the summer to spend with their families, or work, or take their AQs/ABQs or to enroll in workshops. And if you have an issue with the time off that teachers have, contact the Ministry of Education - they're the ones that decide the school year, not the teachers.

8 - When I look at my salary, and I am nowhere near the 11th or 12 year of the grid, it is not the overinflated number that you or Lecce or any other cronie likes to inflate. I also pay for a huge variety of materials and teaching resources out of my own pocket. This year was $2228. And I can only claim a paltry $150 on my taxes. And while nobody forces my hand to go out and purchase all the math manipulatives and books, bins, and countless other materials for the students to have, I do it because I know that part of student success is having the proper materials for the students to use during the year.

9 - Oh and the last thing I wish to impart with you - because I have had to endure this catch phrase over and over again - is that ""I pay your salary because I pay taxes."" Yes, you pay taxes. GUESS WHAT? Teachers have to pay taxes, too.

But I'll just take my supposed $90k a year and go invest it in my secret, off shore account.

And as you said they don't really do anything for that, a lot of places are practically slums and haven't been updated since the early 90's. And this rent increases every year as with everything else while salaries are practically stagnant. Some will say earn more money, upgrade your skills, but it's not likely everyone is not trying to do that already, we can't all earn 100k yr, for you to get that job that pays better it means others don't get it.

But where does that leave us, we have no assets and saving is incredibly difficult. You have a large part of the population who are basically cows to be milked by landlords in perpetuity. At some point in your life your income is essentially flat YOY. Maybe it's the end of your career, maybe it's when you retire, perhaps you're on disability. With rent going up 2% you have a recipe for falling behind. The idea of this infinite growth is completely flawed.

And this is where wealth inequality starts to become a major factor, basically along family money and those who won the birth year lottery. Without having your first home a large portion of your ability to save money for your retirement has been diminished. We are forced to trade our ability to save money for immediate shelter, where as historically that money you spend on a mortgage goes into the equity of your home to be leveraged into retirement. This isn't a problem when you're young but when you get old.

There's also the knock on societal effects, with prices going up and wages remaining the same consumer spending starts to dip. Our economy relies on churn of money and those with more still have a limit on what they can actually buy, you only need a few TV's, a limit to the clothes you buy. Many small businesses will fold. There's also issues with real estate itself, young people can't afford to buy homes, especially the over priced McMansion in the burbs, this will effect current owners retirements too. Rising inequality also means more crime, black markets will flourish, people will do what they have to get by. This also means more drug use, people use drugs to numb themselves and escape the prison of their lives - which also drives crime. And lastly you have rising suicide, which we can see now in men above 50. Your income is flat, life is too expensive, no one will hire you, you are lost and without hope.

This is a time bomb as the new serfs of today start to age. This is not a world I want to live in and the rich probably don't either, as we saw in the 1800's castles are expensive to run. I'd say we have about 20 years to fix this problem, the absolute free market is destroying the people and eventually the masses will get tired of it.",fcxjauq,t3_ejd6hf,1578064329,1578089529.0,/r/ontario/comments/ejd6hf/ontarios_rising_rents_hurt_the_poor_ottawa/fcxjauq/,2020-01-03 15:12:09,2020-01
4935,bigheyzeus,ontario,"&gt; They are not necessarily using it for housing.

Neither are the domestic investors...

Not saying those with the means to own more than 1 home shouldn't have the freedom to do so but supply and demand is supply and demand. Look at the marketing when new developments go up, sometimes it's very blatantly geared towards income property folks as opposed to first time home buyers. Developers don't give a flying fuck as long as they sell, public figures in charge don't give a fuck as long as developers are buying land and people have been brainwashed to feel that if they don't own a home they're failures or if they don't get income property they can't retire.

While I tend to look down upon real estate agents for not really doing anything in selling you on a home, they're certainly good at pulling the wool over your eyes in other ways!

I blame HGTV and all the ""get rich w real estate!"" clowns appealing to Boomers who failed to live within their means and save properly for retirement but that's just me.

4936,Fritz-Haber,ontario,"Im not saying that people in LTC don't deserve any of those things. However, when I was visiting my Grandpa in his LTC facility, none of those things mattered, he was so far gone.

It's sad and hard to see, but when you walk through the hallways of one of those places, pretty much everyone is knocking on deaths door and have very little idea what is going on. 

Personally, I am happy my grandparents were split up. My Grandpa NEEDED much better care then a retirement home could provide. But, my Grandama was and still is sharp as a tack and fully mobile (at 92!). I don't think it would have been good to move her from a facility that didn't have the activities/food selection available to her. She would just be sitting there all day with dying people, no one to socialize, love or give attention to her.

I have no problems with couples staying together as long as possible. I do however have a problem with people taking up space in LTC facilities that don't actually need them just because the spouse has been admitted.

There are a lot of things that staff in retirement homes do that don't require medical training or know-how.

You're pissy because someone is challenging your perceived fantasy land right to make more than degree holding teachers as fucking wait staff.

Reality check: you got used to riding a boom economy gravy train. You're deluded if you think a job that a first-job high schooler can do with a weekend of training is worth $40 an hour.

The gravy train is slowing down rapidly. You would do well to get off your high horse and demand better working conditions (breaks, benefits, retirement savings, living wage) instead of clinging to the absurd tip expectations you hold. Go form a union, start a restaurant of your own, or leave the sector. Nothing else will save your expectations.

What a waste of time. I've spent all this time trying to get a worker to see that their issues are shitty management. When in fact I've just been arguing with a shitty manager who doesn't want to stop treating their employees like trash.

How about this: stop treating people like garbage. Give them breaks. Give them benefits. Give them retirement plans.

4942,shitpost_strategist,alberta,"&gt;It's funny you single out teachers because I actually work with a few of them who wait tables to make ends meet.

This is the risk of these conversations. Of course you're going to misconstrue what I'm saying and move the goalposts around. You turned my statement that servers shouldn't expect to make as much as teachers into a false attack on me apparently thinking teachers shouldn't make more. That's called fighting a straw man.

&gt;  I've also worked with paramedics and have myself worked ESD and the consensus from all these positions that you hold in such high regard and well above ""zero skill order lackeys""? Serving is a high stress job and none of them would do it without tips. 

Holy shit imagine a server comparing the stress of their job to a paramedic. Get your head out of your ass. As I said, I did it for seven years. I worked at three different places.

Guess what I learned? The stress of being a server is directly related to the shittyness of your employer. The more shitty, the more stressful.

You know who I do actually feel bad for in the restaurant? Kitchen staff. Don't give me shit about ""stress"" when they are making half your wage, sweating their asses off for 12 hour shifts. Kitchen staff are the only group I feel bad for.

Otherwise, no. Your job is way less stressful than being a teacher or nurse. Not even fucking close. Again, I did it for seven years. You can't pretend otherwise to me. I was there.


&gt;Why would we unite to change a system where we make $40/hr? People work in this industry because there is potential to make that much and its flexible enough to do it on top of our regular jobs.

Exactly my point. Your greed has reached levels of delusion. You and many others are so entranced by your out of whack wages that you can't see that the entire industry is suffering. Hospitality is a shit show right now.

&gt;My ""zero skill job"" gives me earning potentional around $40/hr and clearly you're not okay with that. Maybe it's because you were awful at it and couldn't earn that much while you were in it? Maybe you're such a hateful person you need to lash out at those you deem ""below you"" to feel better about yourself? Not sure, but it's not a great look my dude. Maybe you should ditch whatever all important job you slaved so hard for because it clearly hasn't made you a happy person.

I'm a perfectly happy person because I never gave in to the selfish entitlement. Enjoy watching more and more of your coworkers get laid off, and employers treating you even more like shit. That's what happens when you sell out.

You could have a living wage, benefits, and retirement savings plans. That's what servers get in non-tipping culture countries. Because they have worker solidarity.
